Extracting \nuseful information from the enormous size of unstructured data is a crucial thing. As the \namount of data becomes more extensive, sophisticated pre-processing techniques are \nrequired to analyze the data. In social networking sites and other online shopping sites, \na massive volume of online product reviews from a large size of customers are available \n[1]. The impact of online product reviews affects 90% of the current e-Commerce mar-\nket [2]. Customer reviews contribute the product sale to an extent and product life in the \nmarket depends on online product recommendations.\n\nOnline feedback is one of the communication methods which gives direct suggestions \nfrom the customers [3, 4]. Online reviews and ratings from customers are another infor-\nmation source about product quality [5, 6]. Customer reviews can help to decide on a new \nsuccessful product launch. Online shopping has several advantages over retail shopping. In \nretail shopping, the customers visit the shop and receive price information but less product \n\nAbstract \n\nLaunching new products in the consumer electronics market is challenging. Develop-\ning and marketing the same in limited time affect the sustainability of such companies. \nThis research work introduces a model that can predict the success of a product. A \nFeature Information Gain (FIG) measure is used for significant feature identification \nand Distributed Memory-based Resilient Dataset Filter (DMRDF) is used to eliminate \nduplicate reviews, which in turn improves the reliability of the product reviews. The \npre-processed dataset is used for prediction of product pre-launch in the market using \nclassifiers such as Logistic regression and Support vector machine. DMRDF method is \nfault-tolerant because of its resilience property and also reduces the dataset redun-\ndancy; hence, it increases the prediction accuracy of the model. The proposed model \nworks in a distributed environment to handle a massive volume of the dataset and \ntherefore, it is scalable. The output of this feature modelling and prediction allows the \nmanufacturer to optimize the design of his new product.\n\nKeywords: Distributed Memory-based, Resilient Distribution Dataset, Redundancy\n\nOpen Access\n\n© The Author(s) 2020.

On the other hand, online shopping sites give product \nreviews and previous customer feedbacks without extra cost and effort for the customers \n[7–10].\n\nInvesting in poor quality products potentially affects an industry’s brand loyalty and this \nstrategy should be changed by the eCommerce firms [5, 11]. Consumer product success \ndepends on different criteria, such as the quality of the product and marketing strategies. \nThe users should provide their valuable and accurate reviews about the products [12]. Cus-\ntomers bother to give reviews about products, whether they liked it or not. If the users \nprovide reviews, then other retailers can create some duplicated reviews [13, 14]. In online \nmarketing, the volume and value of product reviews are examined [15, 16]. The number \nof the product reviews on the shopping sites, blogs and forums has increased awareness \namong the users. This large volume of the reviews leads to the need for significant data \nprocessing methods [17, 18]. The value is the rating on the products. The ratio of positive to \nnegative reviews about the product leads to the quality of the product [19, 20].\n\nFeature selection is a crucial phase in data pre-processing [21]. Selecting features from \nan un-structured massive volume of data reduce the model complexity and improves the \nprediction accuracy. Different feature selection methods existing are the filter, wrapper and \nembedded. The wrapper feature selection method evaluates the usefulness of the feature \nand it depends on the performance of the classifier [22]. The filter method calculates the \nrelevance of the features and analyzes data in a univariate manner. The embedded process \nis similar to the wrapper method. Embedded and wrapper methods are more expensive \ncompared to the filter method. The state-of-art methods in customer review analysis gener-\nally discuss on categorizing positive and negative reviews using different natural language \nprocessing techniques and spam reviews recognition [23]. Feature selection of customer \nreviews increases prediction accuracy, thereby improves the model performance.\n\nAn enhanced method, which is a combination of filter and wrapper method is proposed \nin this work, which focuses on product pre-launch prediction with enhanced distributive \nfeature selection method. Since many redundant reviews are available on the web in large \nvolumes, a big data processing model has been implemented to filter out duplicated and \nunreliable data from customer reviews in-order to increase prediction accuracy. A scalable \nbig data processing model has been applied to predict the success or failure of a new prod-\nuct. The realization of the model has been done by Distributed Memory-based Resilient \nDataset Filter with prediction classifiers.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. “Related work” section discusses related work. “Meth-\nodology” section contains the proposed methodology with System design, Resilient Distrib-\nuted Dataset and Prediction using classifiers. “Results and discussions” section summarizes \nresults and discussion. The conclusion of the paper is shown in “Conclusion and future \nwork” section.\n\nRelated work\nMakridakis et al. [24] illustrate that machine learning methods are alternative methods \nfor statistical analysis of multiple forecasting field. Author claims that statistical methods \nare more accurate than machine learning [25] methods. The reason for less accuracy is \nthe unknown values of data i.e., improper knowledge and pre-processing of data.\n\n\n\nPage 3 of 15Narayanan et al. J Big Data            (2020) 7:13  \n\nDifferent works have been implemented using the Matrix factorization (MF) [14] \nmethod with collaborative filtering [26]. Hao et al. [15] focused on a work based on the \nfactorization of the user rating matrix into two vectors, i.e., user latent and item latent \nwith low dimensionality. The sum of squared distance can be minimized by training a \nmodel that can find a solution using Stochastic Gradient Decent [27] or by least squares \n[28]. Salakhutdinov et al. [29] proposed a method that can be scaled linearly by probabil-\nity related matrix factorization on a big volume of datasets and then comparing it with \nthe single value decomposition method. This matrix factorization outperforms other \nprobability factorization methods like Bayesian-based probabilistic analysis [29] and \nstandard probability-based matrix factorization methods. A conventional approach, like \ntraditional collaborative Filtering [13, 30] method depends on customers and items. The \nuser item matrix factorization technique has been used for implementation purpose. \nIn the recommender system, there is a limitation in the sparsity problem and cold start \nproblem. In addition to the user item matrix factorization method, various analyses and \napproaches have been implemented to solve these recommendation issues.\n\nWietsma et al. [31] proposed a recommender system that gives information about the \nmobile decision aid and filtering function. This has been implemented with a study of \n29 features of student user behavior. The result shows the correlation among the user \nreviews and product reviews from different websites. Jianguo Chen et al. [32] proposed \na recommendation system for the treatment and diagnosis of the diseases. For cluster \nanalysis of disease symptoms, a density-peaked method is adopted. A rule-based apriori \nalgorithm is used for the diagnosis of disease and treatment. Asha et al. [33] proposed \nthe Gini-index feature method using movie review dataset. The sentimental analysis \nof the reviews are performed and opinion extraction of the sentences are done. Gini-\nindex impurity measure improves the accuracy of the polarity prediction by sentimental \nanalysis using Support vector machine [34, 35]. Depending on the frequency of occur-\nrence of a word in the document, the term frequency is calculated and opinion words \nare extracted using the Gini-index method. In this method, high term frequency words \nare not included, as it decreases the precision. The disadvantage of this method is that \nfor the huge volume of data, the prediction accuracy decreases.\n\nLuo et al. [36] proposed a method based on historical data to analyze the quality of \nservice for automatic service selection. Liu et al. [37] proposed a system in a mobile envi-\nronment for movie rating and review summarization. The authors used Latent Semantic \nAnalysis (LSA-based) method for product feature identification and feature-based sum-\nmarization. Statistical methods [38] have been used for identifying opinion words. The \ndisadvantage of this method is that LSA-based method cannot be represented efficiently; \nhence, it is difficult to index based on individual dimensions. This reduces the prediction \naccuracy in large datasets.\n\nLack of appropriate computing models for handling huge volume and redundancy in \ncustomer review datasets is a major challenge. Another major challenge handled in the \nproposed work is the existence of a pre-launch product in the industry based on the \nproduct features, which can be predicted based on the customer feedback in the form \nof reviews and ratings of the existing products. This prediction helps to optimize the \ndesign of the product to improve its quality with the required product features. Many \nof the relational database management systems are handling structured data, which is \n\n\n\nPage 4 of 15Narayanan et al. J Big Data            (2020) 7:13 \n\nnot scalable for big data that handles a large volume of unstructured data. This proposed \nmodel solves the problem of redundancy in a huge volume of the dataset for better pre-\ndiction accuracy.\n\nMethodology\nA pre-launch product prediction using different classifiers has been analysed by huge \ncustomer review and rating dataset. The product prediction is done through the phases \nconsisting of data collection phase, feature selection and duplicate data removal, build-\ning prediction classifier, training as well as testing.\n\nFigure 1 describes the various stages in system design of the model. The input dataset \nconsists of multivariate data which includes categorical, real and text data. Input dataset \nis fed for data pre-processing. Data pre-processing consists of feature selection, redun-\ndancy elimination and data integration which is done using Feature Information Gain \nand Distributed Memory-based Resilient Dataset Filter approach. The cleaned dataset \nis trained using classification algorithms. The classifiers considered for training are Sup-\nport Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR). Further the dataset is tested \nfor pre-launch prediction using LR and SVM.\n\nData collection phase\n\nThis methodology can be applied for different products. Several datasets like Ama-\nzon and flip cart customer reviews are available as public datasets [39–41]. The data-\nset of customer reviews and ratings of seven brands of mobile phones for a period of \n24 months are considered in this work. The mobile phones product reviews are chosen \nbecause of two reasons. New mobile phones are launched into the market industry day \nby day which is one of the unavoidable items in everyone’s life. Market sustainability for \nthe mobile phones is very low.\n\nTable  1 shows a sample set of product reviews in which input dataset consists of \nuser features and product features. User features consists of Author, ReviewID and \nTitle depending on the user. Product feature consists of Product categories, Overall \nratings and Review Content. Since mobile phone is taken as the product, the catego-\nrization is done according to the features such as Battery life, price, camera, RAM, \n\nData collection \n\nCategorical\n\nText\n\nReal\n\nData Pre-\nprocessing\n\nFeature \nIdentification\n\nRedundancy\nRemoval\n\nData \nIntegration\n\nTraining \nDataset Using \nclassification \nalgorithms\n\nSupport \nVector \n\nLogistic \nRegression\n\nTesting Dataset \nUsing \n\nclassification \nalgorithms\n\nLogistic \nRegression\n\nSupport \nVector \n\nFig. 1 Product prelaunch prediction System Design\n\n\n\nPage 5 of 15Narayanan et al.

Input dataset with JSON file format is taken.\n\nDataset pre‑processing\n\nIn data pre-processing, feature selection plays a major role. In the product review \ndataset of a mobile phone, a large number of features exist. Identifying a feature from \ncustomer reviews is important for this model to improve the prediction accuracy. \nEnhanced Feature Information Gain measure has been implemented to identify sig-\nnificant feature.\n\nFeatures are identified based on the content of the product reviews, ratings of the \nproduct reviews and opinion identification of the reviews. Ratings of the product \nreviews can be further categorized based on a rating scale of 5 (1—Bad, 2—Average, \n3—Good, 4—very good, 5—Excellent). For opinion identification of the product, the \npolarity of extracted opinions for each review is classified using Senti-WordNet [42].\n\nFeature Information Gain measures the amount of information of a feature \nretrieved from a particular review. Impurity which is the measure of reliability of fea-\ntures in the input dataset should be reduced to get significant features. To measure \nfeature impurity, the best information of a feature obtained from each review is calcu-\nlated as follows\n\n• Let Pi be the probability of any feature instance \n(\n\nf\n)\n\n of k feature set F =\n{\n\nf1, f2, . . . fk\n}\n\n \nbelonging to  ith customer review Ri , where i varies from 1 to N.\n\n• Let N denotes the total number of customer reviews.\n• Let OR denotes the polarity of extracted opinions of the Review.\n• Let SR denotes product rating scale of review (R).\n\nTable 1 Sample set of Product Reviews\n\n\n\nPage 6 of 15Narayanan et al.

Table 2 shows the significant fea-\nture from customer reviews and ratings.\n\nNext step is to eliminate the redundant reviews and to replace null values of an \nactive customer from the customer review dataset using an enhanced big data pro-\ncessing approach.

J Big Data            (2020) 7:13  \n\nResilient Distributed Dataset\n\nResilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) [43] is a big data processing approach, which allows \nto store cache chunks of data on memory and persevere it as per the requirements. \nThe in-memory data caching is supported by RDD. Variety of jobs at a point of time \nis another challenge which is handled by RDD. This method deals with chunks of data \nduring processing and analysis. RDD can also be used for machine learning supported \nsystems as well as in big data processing and analysis, which happens to be an almost \npervasive requirement in the industry.\n\nIn the proposed method the main actions of RDD are:\n\n• Reduce (β): Combine all the elements of the dataset using the function β.\n• First (): This function will return the first element\n• takeOrdered(n): RDD is returned with first ‘n’ elements.\n• saveAsSequenceFile(path): the elements in the dataset to be written to the local file \n\nsystem with given path.\n\nThe main Transformations of RDD are:\n\n• map(β): Elements from the input file is mapped and new dataset is returned through \nfunction β.\n\n• filter(β): New dataset is returned if the function β returns true.\n• groupBykey(): When called a dataset of (key, value) pairs, this function returns a \n\ndataset of (key, value) pairs.\n• ReduceBykey(β): A (key, value) pair dataset is returned, where the values of each key \n\nare combined using the given reduce function β.\n\nIn the proposed work an enhanced Distributed Memory-based Resilience Dataset \nFilter (DMRDF) is applied. DMRDF method have long Lineage and it is recomputed \nthemselves using prior information, thus it achieves fault-tolerance. DMRDF has been \nimplemented to remove the redundancy in the dataset for product pre-launch predic-\ntion. This enhanced method is simple and fast.\n\n• Let the list of n customers represented as C = {c1, c2, c3 . . . , cn}\n\n• Let the list of N reviews be represented as R = {r1, r2, r3 . . . , rN }\n\n• Let x significant features are identified from feature set (F  ) represented as Fx ⊂ F\n\n• An active customer consists of significant feature having information Gain value \ndenoted by �G\n\nIn the DMRDF method, a product is chosen and its customer reviews are found out. \nEliminate customers with similar reviews on the selected product and also reviews \nwith insignificant features. Calculate the memory-based Resilient Dataset Filter score \nbetween each of the customer reviews with significant features.\n\nLet us consider a set C of ‘n’ number of customers, the set R of ‘N’ number of reviews and \na set of significant features ′F ′\n\nx are considered. The corresponding vectors are represented \nas KC , KR and KFx . Then KRi is represented using a row vector and KFj is represented using \nthe column vector. Each entry KCm denote the number of times the  mth review arrives in \n\n\n\nPage 8 of 15Narayanan et al. J Big Data            (2020) 7:13 \n\ncustomers. The similarities between ith review of mth customer is found out using  L1 norm \nof KRi and KCm . The Distributed Memory-based resilient filter score δ is calculated using the \nEq. (5).\n\nThe δ score is calculated for each customer review whereas the score lies between [0,1]. \nThe significant features are found out using Eq. 4. For customer reviews without significant \nfeatures, �G value will be zero. The reviews with δ score value 0 are found to be insignificant \nwithout any significant feature or opinion and hence those reviews are eliminated and not \nconsidered for further processing in the work. More than one Distributed Memory-based \nresilient filter score value is identified then the second occurrence of the review is consid-\nered as duplicate.\n\nPrediction classifiers\n\nLogistic regression and Support Vector Machine classifiers are the supervised machine \nlearning approaches used in the proposed work for product pre-launch prediction.\n\nLogistic regression (LR)\n\nWe have implemented proposed model using logistic regression analysis for prediction. \nThis model predicts the failure or success of a new product in the market by analysing \nselected product features from customer reviews. A case study has been conducted using \nthe dataset of customer reviews of mobile phones. Success or failure is the predictor vari-\nable used for training and testing the dataset. For training the model 75% of the dataset is \nused and for testing the model, remaining 25% is used.\n\n• Let p be the prediction variable value, assigning 0 for failure and 1 for success.\n• p0 is the constant value.\n• b is the logarithmic base value.\n\nThen the logit function is,\n\nThen the Logistic regression value γ is shown in Eq. (7),\n\n(5)δ =\n\nN\nn\n�\n\ni = 1\n\nm = 1\n\n\n\n\n\n�\n\nKRi ∗\n\n�\n\n�x\nj=1 KFj\n\n��\n\n∗ KCm\n\nKRi · KCm\n\n\n\n ∗ |�G|\n\n(6)\nL0 = b\n\np0+p\nx\n∑\n\ni=1\n\nfi\n\n(7.1)γ =\nL0\n\n(\n\nbp0+p\n∑x\n\ni=1 fi\n)\n\n+ 1\n\n(7.2)=\n1\n\n1+ b\n−\n\n(\n\nb\np0+p\n\n∑x\ni=1\n\nfi\n)\n\n\n\nPage 9 of 15Narayanan et al. J Big Data            (2020) 7:13  \n\nThe probability value of γ lies between [0,1]. In this work, if this value is greater than 0.5 \nthe pre-launch prediction of the product is considered as success and for values less than \n0.5, it is considered as failure.\n\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM)\n\nSVM is the supervised machine learning method, used to learn from set of data to get new \nskills and knowledge. This classification method can learn from data features relationships \n( zi ) and its class \n\n(\n\nyi\n)\n\n that can be applied to predict the success or failure class the product \nbelongs to.\n\n• For a set T  of t training feature vectors, zi ∈ RD, where i = 1 to t.\n• Let yi ∈ {+1,−1} , where +1 belongs to product success class and -1 belongs to product \n\nfailure class.\n• The data separation occurs in the real numbers denoted as X in the D dimensional \n\ninput space.\n• Let w be the hyper plane normal vector element, where w ∈ XD.\n\nThe hyper plane is placed in such a way that distance between the nearest vectors of the \ntwo classes to the hyperplane should be maximum. Thus, the decision hyper plane is calcu-\nlated as,\n\nThe conditions for training dataset d ∈ X , is calculated as\n\nTo maximize the margin the value of w should be minimized.\nThe products in the positive one class (+1) are considered as successful products, [from \n\nEq. (9)] and those in the negative one class (−1) [from Eq. (10)] are in failure class.\n\nExperimental setup\n\nThe proposed system was implemented using Apache Spark 2.2.1 framework. Spark pro-\ngramming for python using PySpark version 2.1.2, which is the Spark python API has been \nused for the application development. An Ubuntu running Apache web server using Web \nServer Gateway Interface is used. Amazon Web Services is used to run some components \nof the software system large servers (nodes), having two Intel Xeon E5-2699V4 2.2 G Hz \nprocessors (VCPUs) with 4 cores and 16 GB of RAM on different Spark cluster configura-\ntions. According to the scalability requirements the software components can be config-\nured and can run on separate servers.\n\n(8)α(w) =\n2\n\n�w�\n\n(9)wtzi + d ≥ 1, where yi = +1.\n\n(10)wtzi + d ≤ −1, whereyi = yi − 1.\n\n\n\nPage 10 of 15Narayanan et al. J Big Data            (2020) 7:13 \n\nResults and discussions\nTo evaluate our prediction system several case studies have been conducted. Support \nVector Machine and Logistic regression classifiers are employed to perform the predic-\ntion. Most significant customer review features are used to analyse the system perfor-\nmance. The prediction accuracy evaluation is taken as one of the system design factors. \nThe system response time is another major concern for big data processing system. In \nthe customer review feature identification, we propose feature information gain and \nDMRDF approach to identify significant features and to eliminate redundant customer \nreviews from the input dataset.\n\nFigure  2 illustrates significant features required for the mobile phone sustainability. \nCustomer reviews and ratings of 7 brands of mobile phones are identified and evalu-\nated with DMRDF using SVM and LR. The graph shows the significant features identi-\nfied by the model against the percentage of customers whose reviews are analysed. 88% \nof the customers identified internal storage as a significant feature. Product price has \nbeen identified by 79% of customers as significant feature. With this evaluation customer \nrequirements for a product can be analysed in a better manner, thus can optimize the \ndesign of the product for better product quality and for product sustainability in the \nindustry.\n\nFigure 3 shows the comparison of the processing time taken by the proposed model \nwith different dataset size against that of the state of art techniques. DMRDF method \ntakes less time for completion of the application compared to other gini-index and latent \nsemantic analysis methods. Hence the proposed model is fast and scalable. It provides a \nhigh-speed processing performance with large datasets. This shows the DMRDF applica-\nbility in big data analytics, whereas gini-index and LSA-based methods processing time \nis larger for large volume of dataset. From the Fig. 3 it can be seen that with 9 GB dataset \ntime taken for prediction using LSA-based model, Gini-index model and DMRDF model \nis 342 s, 495 s and 156 s respectively. With 18 GB dataset time taken for prediction using \nLSA-based model, Gini-index model and DMRDF model 740 s, 910 s and 256 s respec-\ntively. Gini-index and LSA-based methods time taken for 18 GB dataset is twice that of \n9 GB dataset. But for DMRDF model time taken for 18 GB dataset is 1.6 times that of \n\n79%\n\n15%\n\n45%\n35%\n\n22%\n\n40%\n\n22%\n\n39%\n\n88%\n\n53%\n\n21%\n\n61%\n\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n\n100%\n\nPe\nrc\n\nen\nta\n\nge\n o\n\nf C\nus\n\nto\nm\n\ner\ns\n\nIden�fied Significant Features\nFig. 2 Identified Significant Features from Customer reviews and Ratings\n\n\n\nPage 11 of 15Narayanan et al.

DMRDF model has \nmore advantage compared to the other state of art techniques in the case of application \nexecution and performance.\n\nThe reliability of the methods considered for the pre-launch prediction depends on \nprecision [44], recall and prediction accuracy measurement. Table 5 shows a comparison \nof precision, recall and accuracy measures of DMRDF, Gini-index and LSA-based meth-\nods with Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression classifiers using customer \nreviews dataset over a period of 24 months. The results shown in Table 3 are best proved \nusing DMRDF with Support Vector Machine classification with prediction accuracy of \n95.4%. The DMRDF outperforms LSA-based and Gini-index methods in P@R, R@R and \nPA measures. Using proposed method, true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true nega-\ntive (TN) and false negative (FN) are found out. The prediction accuracy (PA), precision \n(P@R) and recall (R@R) are computed using Eqs. (10), (11), and (12) respectively.\n\n(10)PA =\nTP + TN\n\nTP + TN + FP + FN\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n1GB 5GB 9GB 13GB 18GB\n\nGini-index\n\nDMRDF\n\nLSA-based\n\nTi\nm\n\ne \nTa\n\nke\nn \n\nin\n se\n\nc\n\nDataset size\nFig. 3 Dataset Size versus Processing Time Graph\n\nTable 3 Performance comparison of the proposed model with state of art techniques\n\nClassifier Support vector machine\n\nMethod used P@R (precision) PA % \n(prediction \naccuracy)\n\nDMRDF 0.941 0.92 95.4\n\nLSA-based 0.894 0.79 87.5\n\nGini-index 0.66 0.567 83.2\n\nClassifier Logistic regression\n\nMethod used P@R R@R % PA %\n\nDMRDF 0.915 0.849 93.5\n\nLSA-based 0.839 0.753 83\n\nGini-index 0.62 0.52 79.8\n\n\n\nPage 12 of 15Narayanan et al.

Hence DMRDF out-\nperforms the other two methods for customer review feature prediction.\n\nFurthermore Fig.  4, shows the DMRDF, LSA-based and Gini-index approaches as \napplied to the customer reviews and ratings datasets for 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. \nIn DMRDF many features may appear in different customer review aspects, hence \nperformance evaluation will not consider duplicate customer reviews. In Gini- index, \nfeatures are extracted based on the polarity of the reviews and for large dataset P@R \nand R@R are less. The results show that DMRDF method outperforms the other two \nmethods in big data analysis. Gini-index approach does not perform well in customer \nreview feature prediction.\n\nConclusion and future work\nTechnological development in this era brings new challenges in artificial intelligence \nlike prediction, which is the next frontier for innovation and productivity.

A compari-\nson of the analysis has been conducted with state of art techniques like Gini-index \nand LSA-based approaches. The prediction accuracy, precision and recall of DMRDF \nmethod outperforms the other methods. Results show that the prediction accuracy \nof the proposed method increases by 10% using significant feature identification and \nelimination of redundancy from dataset compared to state of art techniques. Large \nfeature dimensionality reduces the prediction accuracy of the LSA-based method \nwhere as number of significant features plays an important role in prediction model-\nling. Results show that proposed DMRDF model is scalable and with huge volume of \ndataset model performance is good as well as time taken for processing the applica-\ntion is less compared to state of art techniques.\n\nResilience property of DMRDF method have long lineage, hence this can achieve \nfault-tolerance. DMRDF model is fast because of the in-memory computation \nmethod. Proposed design can be extended to other product feature identification big \ndata processing domains. As a future work, the model may be developed to make real \ntime streaming predictions through a unified API that searches customer comments, \nratings and surveys from different reliable online websites concurrently to obtain syn-\nthesis of sentiments with an information fusion approach. Since the statistical prop-\nerties of customer reviews and ratings vary over time, the performance of machine \nlearning algorithms can also come down. To cope with the limitations of deep learn-\ning matrix factorization integrated with DMRDF can be adapted.\n\nAbbreviations\nDMRDF: Distributed Memory-based Resilient Dataset Filter; FIG: Feature information gain; RDD: Resilient distributed \ndataset; SVM: Support vector machine; LR: Logistic regression; LSA: Latent semantic analysis; PA: Prediction accuracy; \nP@R: Precision; R@R: Recall; MF: Matrix factorization.\n\nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable.\n\nAuthors’ contributions\nSN designed and implemented the model for Pre-launch product prediction.

This article presents the very first systematic review of the technological \nadvancements in Neuromarketing field over the last 5 years. For this purpose, authors have selected and reviewed a \ntotal of 57 relevant literatures from valid databases which directly contribute to the Neuromarketing field with basic \nor empirical research findings. This review finds consumer goods as the prevalent marketing stimuli used in both \nproduct and promotion forms in these selected literatures. A trend of analyzing frontal and prefrontal alpha band sig-\nnals is observed among the consumer emotion recognition-based experiments, which corresponds to frontal alpha \nasymmetry theory. The use of electroencephalogram (EEG) is found favorable by many researchers over functional \nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in video advertisement-based Neuromarketing experiments, apparently due to \nits low cost and high time resolution advantages. Physiological response measuring techniques such as eye tracking, \nskin conductance recording, heart rate monitoring, and facial mapping have also been found in these empirical stud-\nies exclusively or in parallel with brain recordings. Alongside traditional filtering methods, independent component \nanalysis (ICA) was found most commonly in artifact removal from neural signal. In consumer response prediction and \nclassification, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) \nhave performed with the highest average accuracy among other machine learning algorithms used in these litera-\ntures. The authors hope, this review will assist the future researchers with vital information in the field of Neuromarket-\ning for making novel contributions.\n\nKeywords: Neuromarketing, Neural recording, Machine learning algorithm, Brain computer interface, Marketing\n\n© The Author(s) 2020.

Marketing is the channel between prod-\nuct and consumers which determines the ultimate sale. \n\nWithout effective marketing, a good product fails to \ninform, engage and sustain its targeted audiences [1]. \nThe expanding economy with new businesses is continu-\nously evolving with changing consumer preferences. It \nis hard for the businesses to grow and sustain without \nhaving quantitative or qualitative assessment from their \nconsumers. Newly launched products need even more \neffective marketing to successfully enter into a com-\npetitive market. However, traditional marketing renders \nonly by posteriori analysis of consumer response. Con-\nventional market research depends on surveys, focus \n\nOpen Access\n\nBrain Informatics\n\n*Correspondence:  frawnaque@umassd.edu\n1 Advanced Intelligent Multidisciplinary Systems Lab, Institute \nof Advanced Research, United International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1186/s40708-020-00109-x&domain=pdf\n\n\nPage 2 of 19Rawnaque et al.

These \napproaches have the limitations of time requirement, \nhigh cost and unreliable information, which can often \nproduce inaccurate results. In contrast to the traditional \nmarketing research techniques, Neuromarketing allows \ncapturing consumers’ unspoken cognitive and emotional \nresponse to various marketing stimuli and can forecast \nconsumers’ purchase decisions.\n\nNeuromarketing uses non-invasive brain signal record-\ning techniques to directly measure the response of a \ncustomer’s brain to the marketing stimuli, supersed-\ning the traditional survey methods [3]. Functional mag-\nnetic resonance (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), \nmagnetoencephalography (MEG), transcranial mag-\nnetic stimulator (TMS), positron emission tomography \n(PET), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) etc. \nare some examples of neural recording devices used in \nNeuromarketing research. By obtaining neuronal activ-\nity from the brain using these devices, one can explore \nthe cognitive and emotional responses (i.e., like/dislike, \napproach/withdrawal) of a customer. Different stimuli \ntrigger associated response in a human brain and the \nresponse can be tracked by monitoring the change in \nneuronal signals or brainwaves [4]. Further, the signal \nand image processing techniques and machine learning \nalgorithms have enabled the researchers to measure, ana-\nlyze and interpret the possible meanings of brainwaves. \nThis opens a new door to detect, analyze and predict \nthe buying behavior of customers in marketing research. \nNow with the help of brain–computer interface, the men-\ntal states of a customer, i.e., excitement, engagement, \nwithdrawal, stress, etc., while experiencing a market-\ning stimuli can be captured [5]. Besides these brain sig-\nnal recording techniques, Neuromarketing also utilizes \nphysiological signals, i.e., eye tracking, heart rate and \nskin conductance measurements to gather the insight of \naudience’s physiological responses due to encountering \nstimuli. These neurophysiological signals with advanced \nspectral analysis and machine learning algorithms can \nnow provide nearly accurate depiction of consumers’ \npreferences and likes/dislikes [6–8].\n\nEarly years of Neuromarketing generated a contro-\nversy between the academician and the marketers due \nto its high promises and lack of groundwork. From \nthe claim of peeping into the consumer mind to find-\ning the buy buttons of human brain, Neuromarketing \nhas long been under the scrutiny of the academicians \nand researchers [9, 10]. However, academic research in \nthis field has started to pile up and the scope of Neuro-\nmarketing to reveal and predict consumer behavior is \ngradually becoming evident. Neuromarketing Science \nand Business Association (NMSBA) was established \n\nin 2012 to bridge the gap between academicians and \nNeuromarketers, and it is promoting Neuromarket-\ning research across the world with its annual event of \nNeuromarketing World Forum [11, 12]. It may be pro-\nposed that further dialogue may continue under such a \nplatform for further industry–academia collaboration. \nEvidently, more than 150 consumer neuroscience com-\npanies are commercially operating across the globe and \nbig brands (Google, Microsoft, Unilever, etc.) are using \ntheir insights to impact their consumers in a tailored and \nefficient way. Academic research, especially the high ana-\nlytical accuracy from the engineering part of Neuromar-\nketing has garnered this breakthrough and acceptance \nover the world. Hence, reviewing the building blocks of \nNeuromarketing is essential to evaluate its scopes and \ncapacities, and to contribute new perspective in this \nfield. Numerous literature reviews have been published \nfocusing the theoretical aspect of consumer neurosci-\nence, such as marketing, business ethics, management, \npsychology, consumer behavior, etc. [13–15]. However, \nsystematic literature review from the engineering per-\nspective with a focus on neural recording tools and inter-\npretational methodologies used in this field is absent. In \nthis regard, our article sets its premises to answer the fol-\nlowing questions:\n\n– What are the types of marketing stimuli currently \nbeing used in Neuromarketing?\n\n– What are the brain regions activated by these mar-\nketing stimuli?\n\n– What is the best brain signal recording tool currently \nbeing used in Neuromarketing research?\n\n– How are these brain signals preprocessed for further \nanalysis?\n\n– And what are the current methods or techniques \nused to interpret these brain signals?\n\nThese questions will allow us to gain a comprehensive \nknowledge on the up-to-date research scopes and tech-\nniques in consumer neuroscience. After this brief intro-\nduction, our methodology of conducting this systematic \nreview will be presented, followed by the state-of-the-art \nfindings corresponding to the aforementioned questions \nand synthesis of the important results. We concluded this \nreview with relevant inference from synthesized result \nand a recommendation for future researchers.\n\n2  Methodology\nThe systematic literature review is a process in which \na body of literature is collected, screened, selected, \nreviewed and assessed with a pre-specified objective for \nthe purpose of unbiased evidence collection and to reach \nan impartial conclusion [16]. Systematic review has the \n\n\n\nPage 3 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10  \n\nobligation to explicitly define its research question and to \naddress inclusion–exclusion criteria for setting the scope \nof the investigation. After exhaustive search of existing \nliteratures, articles should be selected based on their rel-\nevance, and the results of the selected studies must be \nsynthesized and assessed critically to achieve clear con-\nclusions [16].\n\nIn this systematic review, we would like to explore \nthe marketing stimuli used in Neuromarketing research \narticles over the last 5 years with their triggered brain \nregions. We would also like to focus on the technologi-\ncal tools used to capture brain signals from these regions, \nand finally deliberate on signal processing and analytical \nmethodologies used in these experiments.\n\nTherefore, the inclusion criteria defined here are  as \nfollows:\n\n– Literatures must be published in the field of Neuro-\nmarketing from 2015 to 2019.\n\n– Studies must use brain–computer interface and/or \nother physiological signal recording device in their \nNeuromarketing experiments.\n\n– Studies must have experimental findings from neu-\nral and/or biometric data used in Neuromarketing \nresearch.\n\nThe exclusion criteria for this review are set as:\n\n– Any other literature review on Neuromarketing are \nexcluded from this review.\n\n– Book chapters are excluded from this review. Since \nNeuromarketing is comparatively a new research \nfield, alongside relevant academic journal articles, \nbook chapters conducting empirical experiments \nusing BCI can only be included.\n\n– Literatures written/published in any language other \nthan English are excluded from this article.\n\nTo serve the purpose of this systematic literature \nreview, a total of 931 articles were found across the \n\ninternet by using the search item “Neuromarketing” \nand “Neuro-marketing” in valid databases. Among the \nscreened publications, Table  1 presents the database \nsource of selected 57 research articles including book \nchapters, which directly contribute to the Neuromarket-\ning field with basic or empirical research findings.\n\nAs for the aggregation of relevant existing literatures, \nthe researchers defined that the search for articles would \nbe performed in six databases—Science Direct, Emer-\nald Insight, Sage, IEEE Xplore, Wiley Online Library, \nand Taylor Francis Online. After the initial article accu-\nmulation, the articles were exhaustively screened by \nthe authors by reviewing their title, abstract, keywords \nand scope to match the objective of this research. Once \nthe studies met our aforementioned inclusion criteria, \nthey were selected for further review and critical analy-\nsis. Table 2 classifies the selected articles in terms of the \naforementioned dimensions.\n\nBy exploring the articles selected to develop this sys-\ntematic review, it was possible to successfully categorize \nthe trends and advancements in Neuromarketing field in \nfollowing dimensions:\n\n i. Marketing stimuli used in Neuromarketing \nresearch\n\n ii. Activation of the brain regions due to marketing \nstimuli\n\n iii. Neural response recording techniques\n iv. Brain signal processing in Neuromarketing\n v. Machine learning applications in Neuromarketing.\n\nSome of these Neuromarketing studies have used \neye tracking, heart rate, galvanic skin response, facial \naction coding, etc., with or without brain signal \nrecording techniques to gauge the consumer’s hidden \nresponse. As they are the response from autonomous \nnervous system (ANS), they have proven themselves \nas successful means of exploring consumer’s focus, \narousal, attention and withdrawal actions. Hence, this \nstudy includes articles those empirically used these \n\nTable 1 Number of articles found and selected\n\nName of the database Results: search “Neuromarketing” Results: search “Neuro-marketing” Articles selected\n\nScience direct 281 55 12\n\nWiley online 111 11 7\n\nEmerald insight 115 8 14\n\nIEEE 34 0 14\n\nSage 12 15 6\n\nTaylor Francis online 106 36 4\n\nTotal found: 806 Total found: 125 Total selected: 57\n\n\n\nPage 4 of 19Rawnaque et al.

To conduct a system-\natic review on this matter, it is important to recall the \ninterconnection between brain functions with human \nbehavior and actions triggered by the  external stimuli. \nThe knowledge of brain anatomy and the physiologi-\ncal functions of brain areas as well as the physiological \nresponse due to external stimuli along with it, makes \nit possible to model brain activity and predict hidden \nresponse. For this purpose, current neural imaging sys-\ntems and neural recording systems have contributed \nmuch to capture the true essence of consumer prefer-\nences. This section will discuss the marketing stimuli, \ntheir targeted brain regions, neural and physiological \nsignal capturing technologies used over the last 5 years \nin Neuromarketing research. Comparing these signals \nwith their associated anatomical functionality some stud-\nies have already reached high accuracy. A number of the \nselected studies have used machine learning techniques \nto predict like/dislike and possible preference from the \ntest subjects.\n\nFor the purpose of Neuromarketing experiments, the \nfollowing literatures selected right-handed participants, \nwith normal or corrected-to-normal vision, free of cen-\ntral nervous system influencing medications and with no \nhistory of neuropathology.\n\n3.1  Marketing stimuli used in Neuromarketing\nAs Neuromarketing is a focus of marketers and consumer \nbehavior researchers, different strategies from market-\ning have been applied in Neuromarketing and they are \nbeing investigated for quantitative assessment from neu-\nrological data. Nemorin et al. asserts that Neuromarket-\ning differentiates from any other marketing models as \nit bypasses the thinking procedures of consumers and \ndirectly enters their brain [74]. Over the last 5  years, \nNeuromarketing stimuli has been mainly in two forms—\nproducts with/without price, and promotions. Product \ncan be defined as physical object or service that meets \nthe consumer demand. In Neuromarketing, product can \nbe physical such as tasting a beverage to conceptual like \na 3D (three dimensional) image of the product. Price in \nNeuromarketing experiments is mostly seen as a stimuli \nis most of the time intermingled with product or pro-\nmotion. However, it plays an important role that deter-\nmines the decision of test subjects to buy or not to buy \nthe product [75].\n\nConsumer response to a product has been recognized \nby either physically experiencing the product or by visu-\nalizing the image of  it. To understand the user esthetics \nof 3D shapes, Chew et  al. [17], used virtual 3D bracelet \nshapes in motion and recorded the brain response of \ntest subjects with EEG with motion. As 3D visualiza-\ntion of objects for preference recognition is a new area \n\nof research, the authors used mathematical model (Gie-\nlis superformula) to create 3D bracelet-like objects. \nTheir study displayed 3D shapes appear like bracelets as \nthe product to subjects. Using the 3D shapes gave the \nauthors an advantage to produce as many of 60 bracelet \nshapes to conduct the research on. Another new prod-\nuct was the E-commerce products presented to the test \nsubjects by Yadava et al. and Çakar et al. [18, 34]. Yadava \net  al. proposed a predictive modeling framework to \nunderstand consumer choice towards E-commerce prod-\nucts in terms of “likes” and “dislikes” by analyzing EEG \nsignals. In showing E-commerce product, they showed a \ntotal of 42 product images to the test participants. These \nproduct images were mainly of apparels and accessory \nitems such as shirts, sweaters, shoes, school bags, wrist \nwatches, etc. The test participants were asked to disclose \ntheir preference in terms of likes and dislikes after view-\ning the items  [18]. Çakar et  al. used both product and \nprice to explore the experience during product search of \nfirst-time buyers in E-commerce. To motivate the partici-\npants, this research provided each participants around \n73 USD as a gift card to use during the experiment. The \ntest participants were asked to search and select three \nproducts of their interest from an e-commerce website \nand reach the maximum of their gift card limit to acti-\nvate. Test subjects often experienced negative emotion \nwhile being unable to find necessary buttons such as “add \nto cart” or “sorting options” [34]. These Neuromarketing \nexperiments on E-commerce products may help develop-\ners to build better user experience. Retail businesses lose \nlarge amount of money when they invest in the wrong \nproduct. Among retail products, shoes have thousands \nof blueprints for manufacturing. Producing thousands \nof shoes of different designs to satisfy consumers can be \nlaborious and unprofitable since a large number of the \ndesigns turn out to be failures. Baldo et al. directly used \n30 existing image of shoe designs to show the test sub-\njects to and to choose from a mock shop showing on the \nscreen [39]. EEG signals were recorded during the whole \nshoe selection time and then subjects were asked to rate \nthe shoes in a rank of 1 to 5 of Likert scale. This experi-\nment helped realize brain response-based prediction can \nsupersede self-report-based methods, as the simulation \non sales data showed 12.1% profit growth for survey-\nbased prediction, and 36.4% profit growth for the brain \nresponse-based prediction.\n\nSimilar to the shoe experiment, Touchette and Lee [21] \nexperimented on the choice of apparel products among \nyoung adults, based on Davidson’s frontal asymmetry \ntheory. EEG signals were recorded while 34 college stu-\ndents viewed three attractive and three unattractive \napparel products on a high-resolution computer screen \nin a random order. Pozharliev et  al. [20] experimented \n\n\n\nPage 6 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10 \n\non the emotion associated with visualizing luxury brand \nproducts vs. regular brand products. The experiment dis-\nplayed 60 luxury items and 60 basic brand items to 40 \nfemale undergraduate students to recognize the brain \nresponse of seeing high emotional value (luxury) prod-\nucts in social vs. alone atmosphere. The study found \nthat, luxury brand products invoked a higher emotional \nvalue in social atmosphere which could be utilized by the \nmarketers. Bosshard et al. and Fehse et al. experimented \non brand images and the comparison between the brain \nresponses associated with preferred and not preferred \nbrands [32, 33]. In the study performed by Bosshard et al., \nconsumer attitude towards established brand names were \nmeasured via electroencephalography. Subjects were \nshown 120 brand names in capital white letter in Tahoma \nfont on black background and without any logo while \ntheir brain responses were recorded. On the other hand, \nFehse et al. compared the brain response of test subjects \nwhile they visualized blocks of popular vs. organic food \nbrand logos. These experiments on brand image may help \nmarketers to recognize the implicit response of consum-\ners on different types of branding.\n\nAs price is mentioned as an important factor that \ndetermines the user’s interest on purchasing a product, \na number of Neuromarketing studies have used price \nalongside the products. In the aforementioned study \nby Çakar et  al. [34] price was displayed while recording \nbrain response during first-time e-commerce user expe-\nrience. Marques et al. [22], Çakir et al. [24], Gong et al. \n[35], Pilelienė and Grigaliūnaitė [36], Hsu and Chen [26], \nBoccia et al. [37], Venkatraman et al. [38], and Baldo et al. \n[39] have included price as a marketing stimuli with the \nproduct or promotional.\n\nAn interesting concept was tried by Boccia et  al. to \nrecognize the relation between corporate social respon-\nsibilities and consumer behavior. The author attempted \nto identify if consumers were willing to pay more for the \nproducts from socially or environmentally responsible \ncompany. Consumers were found to prefer the conven-\ntional companies over the socially responsible companies \ndue to lesser price. Marques et  al. [22] investigated the \ninfluence of price to compare national brand vs. own-\nlabeled branded products. In the experiment of Çakir \net  al, product then product and price were shown to \nthe subjects before decision-making time and the brain \nresponses were recorded through fNIRS [24]. Sometimes \nprice can play a passive role in the form of discounts or \ngifts in a promotional. Gong et al. innovatively designed \nan experiment to compare consumer brain response \nassociated with promotional using discount (25% off) vs. \ngift-giving (gift value equivalent to the discount) mar-\nketing strategies. Their study found that lower degree of \nambiguity (e.g., discounts) better motivates consumer \n\ndecision-making [35]. Hsu and Chen used price as a con-\ntrol variable in their wine tasting experiment. As price \nplays a pivotal role in purchase decision, two wines were \nselected of approximately equal price $15. Then the EEG \nsignals of test subjects were recorded during the wine \ntasting session [26].\n\nPromotion is the communication from the marketers’ \nend to influence the purchase decision of consumers [75]. \nIn Neuromarketing research, promotion is usually found \nas the TV commercials and short movies for advertise-\nment. One of the key focus of Neuromarketers is to \nevaluate the consumer engagement of advertisements. \nPredicting the engagement of advertisements before \nbroadcasting them on air, ensures higher rate of success-\nful promotions.\n\nIn 2015, Yang et al. used six smartphone commercials \nof different brands to compare among them in terms \nof extract cognitive neurophysiological indices such as \nhappiness, surprise, and attention as well as behavio-\nral indices (memory rate, preference, etc.) [41]. A com-\nmon experimental design procedure is found among the \npromotion-based Neuromarketing experiments, that is \nsubjects are first made comfortable in the experimental \nsetting, consecutive advertisements were placed at a time \ndistance no shorter than 10 s and consecutive advertise-\nments used neutral stimuli such as white screen, green \nscenario, blank in between them to stabilize the test \nparticipants.\n\nThe Neuromarketing experiments of Soria Morillo \net  al. [40, 43] tried to find out the electrical activity of \naudience brain while viewing advertisement relevant to \naudiences’ taste. They display used 14 TV commercials \ndisplayed to their 10 test subjects for their experiment \nand predicted like or dislike response from audience \nwith the help of advanced algorithms. Cherubino et  al. \n[42] investigated cognitive and emotional changes of \ncerebral activity during the observation of TV commer-\ncials among different aged population. Among seven TV \ncommercials displayed during the experiment, one com-\nmercial with strong images was analyzed for the adults’ \nand older adults’ reaction. Other than them, Vasiljević \net  al. [44] used Nestle advertisement to measure con-\nsumer attention though pulse analysis; Daugherty et  al. \n[46] replicated an experiment of Krugman (1971) using \nboth TV advertisements and print media advertise-\nments to recognize how consumers look and think; Royo \net  al. [47] focused on consumer response while viewing \nadvertisements of sustainable product designs. For their \nexperiment, an animated commercial was made contain-\ning verbal narrative of sustainable product and an exist-\ning commercial was used to convey the visual narrative \nof conventional product. Venkatraman  et al. focused \non measuring the success of TV advertisements using \n\n\n\nPage 7 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10  \n\nneuroimaging and biometric data  [38]. Randolph and \nPierquet [51] showed super bowl commercials to under-\ngraduate students to compare the class rank of the com-\nmercials and the neural response from the test subjects. \nNomura and Mitsukura [52] identified emotional states \nof audiences while watching favorable vs. unfavorable TV \ncommercials. They selected 100 TV commercials among \nwhich 50 commercials were award winning which were \nlabeled as favorable advertisements. Singh et al. [56] used \npromotion in the form of static vs. video advertisements \nto predict the success of omnichannel marketing strate-\ngies. Ungureanu et al. [53] measured user attention and \narousal by eye tracking while surfing through web page \ncontaining static advertisements, while Goyal and Singh \n[54] utilized facial biometric sensors to model an auto-\nmated review systems for video advertisements. Oon \net al. [55] used merchandise product advertisement clips \nto recognize user preference. Singh et al. [56] used video \nadvertisements to measure visual attentions of audiences.\n\nMost of the TVC (television commercials) in these lit-\neratures had a standard time of 30 s. In Neuromarketing, \nthese TVCs were displayed in between other videos such \nas documentary film, gaming video, drama, etc., to cap-\nture the true response of consumers.\n\nSometimes Neuromarketing  is observed dealing with \nadvertisement of different purposes, such as social adver-\ntisements or gender-related advertisements. The appli-\ncation of Neuromarketing in social advertisement is to \npredict the success of these ads to reach its messages to \nthe targeted social groups [45, 49, 69]. Chen et  al. [49] \nexperimented on the neural response of adolescent audi-\nences while they are exposed to e-cigarette commercials. \nAnother social advertisement stimuli of smoking cessa-\ntion frames was used by Yang [45], to understand what \ntypes of frames (positive/negative) achieve better atten-\ntion from smokers and non-smokers. Gender plays a \nsubstantial role in advertisement industry from celebrity \nendorsement to gender-targeted marketing. Missaglia \net  al. [69] conducted a research on fast marketed con-\nsumer goods (FMCG) advertisements with celebrity vs. \nnon-celebrity female spokesperson. Casado-Aranda et al. \n[50] worked on gender-targeted advertisements using \ncongruent vs. incongruent product–voice combination. \nThese studies show us the diversity of marketing stimuli \nfor future Neuromarketing applications.\n\n3.2  Activation of brain regions due to marketing stimuli\nHuman brain is a matter of profound astonishment. \nThe anatomical development of our brain resulted in \nthe complex web of cognitive and emotional process we \nexperience every day. The evolution of vertebrate brain \nwas initially proposed by Paul D. MacLean  in his Tri-\nune Brain model  [76]. In his hypothesis, evolution of \n\nvertebrate brain is formed through three phases. First \nthe reptilian complex, which indicates the association \nof instincts with the anatomical structure basal gan-\nglia. The paleomammalian complex consists of sep-\ntum, amygdalae, hypothalamus, hippocampal complex, \nand cingulate cortex as the limbic system. These orga-\nnelles were associated with motivation and emotional \nresponse of mammalian brain. Finally, neomammalian \ncomplex consists of cerebral neocortex or the outer \nlayer of advanced mammalian brain, which is particu-\nlarly a unique feature of human brain. In the cerebral \nneocortex, we find four lobes which control our sen-\nsory, motor, emotional and cognitive processes [76]. \nThe triune brain model has been rejected by new neu-\nroscientists due to the interconnectivity of human brain \nstructures and their function. However, the anatomical \nstructure of human brain explained by this theory plays \na vital role in recognizing cognitive, emotional and \nbehavioral process.\n\nUnderstanding the anatomy of human brain has \nshowed itself indispensable in Neuromarketing \nresearch, as its functionality is deeply associated with \nthe interpretation of neural response. The outer layer of \nthe human brain is a complex system organized in four \nlobes, namely (frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital \nlobes), each having distinct functionalities for cogni-\ntive, emotional, and motor responses. The frontal lobe \nis the region where most of our thoughts and conscious \ndecisions are made  [77]. Cognitive decision-making \nmainly takes part in the prefrontal region of this lobe, \nand movement-related decisions are made in the end \npart of frontal lobe. Information about taste, touch and \nmovement is processed by the parietal lobe. The occipi-\ntal lobe is the primary center for visual processing, \nand the temporal lobe is responsible for visual memo-\nries, auditory recognition and integrating new sensory \ninformation with memories  [78]. Besides the primary \nlobes, cerebral cortex brain anatomy has gyri and sulci \nwhich create the folded appearance of the brain. The \ngyri functions on increasing surface area for informa-\ntion processing. Alongside the primary lobes, gyri of \nthese lobes can be considered as the region of interest \n(ROI) in neural imaging techniques [79].\n\nDeeper structures of the human brain consist-\ning thalamus, amygdalae, etc., produces sensory and \ninstinctual responses which are later transported to \nthe cerebral cortex. Hypothalamus works as the master \ncontrol of our autonomic system. Sleep, hunger, thirst, \nblood pressure, body temperature, sexual arousal are \ncontrolled and regulated by hypothalamus. Thalamus \non the other hand regulates sensory information, atten-\ntion and memory. Amygdalae originate our emotional \n\n\n\nPage 8 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10 \n\nresponse and hippocampus is the mainframe of our \nmemory [77].\n\nRetrieving information from brain requires diverse \ntypes of methodology. In Neuromarketing experiments, \ndifferent parts of brain are selected for retrieving dis-\ntinct information. An experiment which solely focuses \non attention might only look at the signals from frontal \nlobe, whereas experiments focusing on buyer’s motiva-\ntion might want to look at deeper structures [38].\n\nAccording to Soria Morillo et al., brain signal acquisi-\ntion may capture neural signals either from cerebral cor-\ntex or from the deeper layer of the brain [40, 43]. Their \nexperiment on TV advertisement liking recognition ini-\ntially uses information only from prefrontal cortex using \na single electrode EEG device. Their experiment showed, \nit is possible to classify like/dislike with information col-\nlected solely from frontal lobe.\n\nSimilarly, Cherubino et  al. emphasized on the signifi-\ncance of frontal cortex (FC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) \nin Neuromarketing studies. PFC processes the conscious \nand unconscious cognitive and emotional information. \nHence, devices using only a single sensor select PFC as \ntheir signal acquisition region  [42]. Also, ventromedial \nprefrontal cortex corresponds to motivational behaviors, \nimaging of which by fMRI or MEG can reveal purchase \nmotivations [22].\n\nNeural communication in the brain is conducted \nthrough the action potentials, or the firing of neu-\nrons  [80]. A neuronal signal is the electrochemical \ninformation that neurons send to each other. These \ninformation are acquired as signals of non-linear pat-\ntern called the brainwaves  [80]. These brainwaves are \nfurther associated with the neural signature of brain \nstates. The neural signature is divided into frequency \nbands known as rhythms, such as the delta (0.1–4  Hz), \ntheta (4–8  Hz), alpha (8–12  Hz), beta (12–30  Hz), and \ngamma (30–90  Hz). These frequency bands are related \nto different brain states, regions, functions or patholo-\ngies. Delta (δ) waves are characteristic of deep sleep and \nhave not been explored for BCI applications  [81]. Theta \n(θ) waves are enhanced during sleep in adults and often \nrelated to various brain disorders. During wakefulness \nunder relaxed conditions alpha (α) waves with moder-\nate amplitude appear spontaneously. Beta (β) waves have \nless amplitude and are strongly related to motor control \nand engagement or decision-making procedure. Gamma \n(γ) waves are associated with movement-related activ-\nity of the brain and intensely observed in invasive neural \nrecording [81].\n\nIn Neuromarketing, beta wave amplitudes are associ-\nated with reward processing which can further predict \nsuccess of a product or TVC (Boksem and Smitds) [57].\n\nFrontal alpha asymmetry is a key concept of hem-\nisphere-based like–dislike classification approach. \nWhen the brain is considered as two hemispheres, left \nand right frontal cortices show hemispheric asymme-\ntry in their activation during processing positive and \nnegative emotion. Another term for emotional engage-\nment, Approach–Withdrawal Index refers to the emo-\ntional response from Frontal Alpha Asymmetry theory \n[34]. Frontal Asymmetry Index is a marker of approach \nand avoidance. “Emotional Engagement” in Neuromar-\nketing is expressed as the power of specific frequency \nbands from left and right frontal regions. The F3/F4 and \nF7/F8 electrodes are the best candidates for these EEG \npower reception as they are positioned at the most sen-\nsitive places (International 10–20 System). The alpha \nfrequency band (8–12  Hz) is commonly used in the \nfrontal alpha asymmetry theory. However, as the alpha \nactivity corresponds with relaxation and meditation, it \nis negatively correlated with cognitive engagement.\n\nFrontal Asymmetry Index is measured from the \nequation:\n\nHigher the Frontal Asymmetry Index value, the more \napproach response is obtained from the test subjects \nand vice versa. This high or positive asymmetry score \ncan determine pleasant feeling of a test subject and vice \nversa, which was explored in the study conducted by \nTouchette and Lee [21].\n\nNeuroimaging and neural signal recording devices \nuse these locations and brain states to map the mind of \na consumer. A standard 10–20 system has been estab-\nlished, which is an internationally recognized method \nto apply the EEG sensors or electrodes on a human \nscalp. EEG electrodes under 10–20 system have let-\nters to express their location on skull such as prefron-\ntal (Fp), frontal (F), temporal (T), parietal (P), occipital \n(O), and central (C). Even number of electrodes are \nplaced on the right side of the head.\n\nOn the other hand, a test subject is placed inside an \nfMRI machine where the activities of the cortices can \nbe recorded from the hemodynamic response or blood \noxygen level-dependent (BOLD) imaging process. \nfMRI can look deeper within the spatial range from \nmillimeters to centimeters. This enables Neuromar-\nketing researchers using fMRI imaging to examine the \nresponse at putamen, thalamus, amygdalae and even in \nthe hippocampus.\n\nFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) \nis another new brain imaging tool which uses the \n\nFrontal Asymmetry Index\n\n= ln\nAlpha Power of Right F4 or F8\n\nAlpha Power of Left F3 or F7\n.\n\n\n\nPage 9 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10  \n\nhemodynamic responses associated with neuronal \nactivities [24, 60]. However, fNIRS has a lower spatial \nresolution than fMRI and cannot look deeper than 4 cm.\n\nAlongside brain regions associated with neural \nresponse, the human has a peripheral system which \ncorresponds to cognitive and emotional processes. Eye \nmovement, skin conductance, heart rate, facial expres-\nsion all are result of neural processes. Eye tracking is \nprimarily considered as the physiological response in \nconsumer neuroscience, however studies have suggested \neye tracking as a result of activation of the visual cortex \nor a secondary neural response [34, 36, 38, 53, 70].\n\nNeuromarketing experiments focused on the affect–\ncircumflex coordinate or valance–arousal coordinate use \nautonomic nervous system (ANS) response from sweat \nglands of hands or galvanic skin response (GSR), and car-\ndiovascular measure or heart rate (HR). GSR is viewed as \na sensitive and convenient measure for indexing changes \nin sympathetic arousal associated with emotion, cogni-\ntion and attention. On the other hand, HR correlates with \nthe emotional valence of a stimulus, e.g., the positive or \nnegative component of the emotion [34].\n\nConsidering the available regions to capture signals \nfrom, it is highly likely that Neuromarketing will expo-\nnentially improve its recognition and predictions in user \nresponse and preferences.\n\n3.3  Neural response recording techniques\nThe groundwork in Neuromarketing field is evidently \nindebted to the advancement of neuroimaging and neu-\nral recording tools. Neurophysiological tools, such as \nelectroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic \nresonance imaging (fMRI), eye tracking, skin conduct-\nance, heart rate, etc., made it feasible to conduct the aca-\ndemic and commercial Neuromarketing research. Many \nresearch-grade neurophysiological and biometric signal \ncapturing devices are now available in the market. How-\never, some devices have cost and mobility advantages \nover the others and therefore replacing the expensive and \nimmobile devices for Neuromarketing purpose.\n\nAmong all neuroimaging devices, functional mag-\nnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been the most \nwidely used neuroimaging technique in Neuromar-\nketing research during the initial time of consumer \nneuroscience. The reason behind the wide acceptance \nof fMRI is that it offers the identification of cerebral \nregions associated with cognitive and emotional pro-\ncess. Combining magnetic field and radio waves, fMRI \nproduces a sequence of images of the cerebral activ-\nity by measuring the blood flow of the cerebral cor-\ntex [38]. The signal imaged in fMRI is called BOLD \n(blood oxygen level dependent) signal. This technol-\nogy also allows 3D views of the coordinates that denote \n\ncertain location, making possible to investigate deeper \nbrain structures [57]. The primary disadvantages of \nthis method are that it is very expensive and till now \nhas a poor temporal resolution. The computer screen \nused in fMRI refreshes the image every 2 to 5  s. This \nlow temporal resolution to the order of seconds due to \nthe time requirement of the cerebral blood flow’s incre-\nment after being exposed to the stimuli, makes fMRI \nunsuitable for tracking brain activities to the order of \nmilliseconds, which is required in video advertisement \nanalysis. Other disadvantage is the head of the subject \nmust remain static during the whole image recording \nprocess [62]. This restriction causes complex preproc-\nessing and movement-related artifact removal from the \nfMRI signals. A number of studies, i.e., Venkatraman \net  al. [38], Marques et  al. [22], Hubert et  al. [25], Hsu \nand Cheng [26], Chen et al. [49], Casado-Aranda et al. \n[50], Wang et al. [30], Wolfe et al. [31], Fehse et al. [33], \netc., have used fMRI as the neuroimaging technique \nin their Neuromarketing studies. fMRI in all studies \nrequired the test subjects to remain static and displayed \nthe subjects the images and commercials of products \nfor 3–5 s. Later the subjects had to make purchase deci-\nsion within 5 s after their exposure to the stimuli [50]. \nResearchers over the last 5  years  are found using 3-T \nfMRI scanner 3.0-T Siemens Magnetom Trio system \nMRI Scanner equipped with a 32-channel bridge head \ncoil (Hubert and Hsu and Cheng) [25, 62] and 3 Tesla \nSiemens Verio scanner (Wang et  al. [30]). Cost of an \nfMRI machine can be from $500,000 to $3 million vary-\ning on its spatiotemporal resolution.\n\nAlongside fMRI, electroencephalography (EEG) is \nanother popular tool used in Neuromarketing research. \nNumber of research in Neuromarketing using EEG \ndevices is increasing due to EEG’s cost efficiency high \ntemporal resolution and mobility advantages. The EEG \nmeasures electrical activity in the cerebral cortex, the \nouter layer of the brain. EEG devices are placed follow-\ning the 10–20 system. According to the 10–20 system, \nthe 10 and 20 refer to the actual percentage of distances \nbetween adjacent electrodes which are either 10% or 20% \nof the total front–back or right–left distance of the skull \n[82]. As EEG is portable and allows capturing signal from \ncerebral cortex with high temporal resolution, it is mainly \nused in TV commercial engagement or success analy-\nsis. EEG signal of interest in Neuromarketing are mainly \nevent-related potential (ERP), and late positive potential \n(LPP). ERP and LPP are used by Pozharliev et al. [20] to \nmeasure the emotional value of luxury products. Çakar \net al. [34] used ERP to explore the experience of first-time \nuser of E-commerce product. Pilelienė and Grigaliūnaitė \n[36]) used ERP along with eye tracking signal to measure \nthe impact of celebrity spokesman in TVC. Shen et  al. \n\n\n\nPage 10 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10 \n\n[23] used ERP and LPP to explore the influence of rating \nreviews on online products.\n\nResearch-grade EEG devices are vastly used in Neuro-\nmarketing. Emotiv Epoc and Emotive Epoc+ were found \nas the mostly commonly used EEG devices in the review. \nThese devices were used in the studies of Yang et al. [45], \nChew et  al. [17], Soria Morillo et  al. [40], Yadava et  al. \n[18], Royo et al. [47], Jain et al. [63], and Singh et al. [56]. \nEmotive Epoc+ is a moveable, cost-effective EEG head-\nset having 14 electrodes those cover the frontal, tempo-\nral, parietal and occipital lobes with channels AF3, F7, \nF3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4. The \nacquired brain signals from Emotiv Epoc+ are highly \ndependable and have already been used in these scientific \nresearches. Another popular EEG device in Neuromar-\nketing, NeuroSky Mindwave, has only one sensor placed \non the prefrontal cortex of the head or the forehead. \nUnlike EEG devices with wet electrodes, Neurosky Mind-\nwave employs a biosensor which does not require any \nconductive medium to be applied on the test subject’s \nscalp [40]. With the help of NeroSkyLab, the provided \nscientific research tool, data viewing and analysis can be \nconducted easily by non-engineer population. In 2015, \nSoria Morillo et  al. and Ogino and Mitsukura in 2018 \nconducted Neuromarketing experiment with NeuroSky \ndevice and with the help of machine learning algorithm, \ntheir choice prediction accuracy was over 70% [40, 68]. A \n10-channel EEG device BrainAmp, from BrainProducts \nGmBh was used in the Neuromarketing experiment con-\nducted by Cherubino et  al. [42]. Another device EEGO \nSports from ANT Neuro (32 channels) was used to ana-\nlyze non-linear features of EEG signals by Oon et al. [55]. \nB-alert X10 headset from ABM consisting 9 electrode \nchannels is found in use by the experiment of Chew et al. \n[17]. 8-channel E-Prime from Neuroscan is another EEG \ndevice is used in the sales strategy experiment by Gong \net al. and Touchette et al. conducted their apparel liking \nexperiment with NeXus-10 biofeedback system. EEG \ndevices have different sampling rates starting from 128 \nto 512  Hz. This sampling rate determines the highest \nfrequency recordable by the EEG device. In general EEG \nhas a lower frequency spectrum, having Gamma band up \nto 90 Hz. This gives researchers advantage to choose the \nright EEG device from numerous manufacturers. Price \nof EEG devices depends mainly on the number of elec-\ntrode channels and performance. Cost of EEG device \nstarts from $99 and can go beyond $25,000, which gives \nresearchers buying flexibility.\n\nMagnetoencephalography (MEG) uses magnetic \npotentials to record brain activity at the scalp level, using \nmagnetic field sensitive detectors in the helmet placed \non the subject’s head. Magnetic field is not influenced \nby the type of tissue (blood, brain matter, bones), unlike \n\nelectrical field-based EEG, and can indicate the depth of \nthe location in the brain with high spatial and temporal \nresolution [3]. Similar to MEG, transcranial magnetic \nstimulation (TMS) uses varying magnetic field [83] gen-\nerated by electromagnetic induction using an iron core. \nTMS can stimulate targeted part of the brain, which \nenables it to conduct social or behavioral experiments. \nTMS and MEG are also used frequently in Neuromar-\nketing experiments. However, the selected databases for \nthis review did not contain any Neuromarketing research \narticles using these technologies over the last 5 years.\n\nThe electromyography (EMG) measures electrical \nactivity produced by skeletal muscles when the mus-\ncles contracts and expands in order to move the body \n[70]. Also EMG is generated from the autonomic nerv-\nous activity related to emotional or mental activity. In \nNeuromarketing research, facial EMG is the best meas-\nure of the valence of the emotional reaction as it records \nfacial muscle movement from two different muscles, i.e., \nzygomaticus muscle and corrugator muscle. Zygomatic \nmuscle is found to react more while exposed to positive \nstimuli [70].\n\nBesides these brain signal recordings, eye tracking \nis the most popular method for analyzing consumer \nresponse. Eye tracking offers to measure visualization \ntime and gaze path across a screen in Neuromarket-\ning experiments. Besides tracking eye movement, pupil \ndilation measurement allows one to associate audi-\nence’s focus and arousal to the marketing stimuli. In the \nreviewed literatures, Tobii Pro X2-30 system from Tobii \nTechnology was found as the most popular eye track-\ning device. In 2019, Etzold et  al. used this eye tracking \ndevice to explore attention research on online book-\ning [48]. Tobii Pro can also cooperate with fMRI-based \nNeuromarketing experiment (Venkatraman [38]). Other \nthan Tobii, Eye Tribe is found in use by Çakar et al. [34]. \nUngureanu et al. used eye tracking to measure the atten-\ntion level of consumers while displaying static advertise-\nments of cars and clothing products [53]. Figure 1 depicts \nthe most popular methods of neural response recording \ni.e. EEG, fMRI and eye tracking used in the Neuromar-\nketing experiments.\n\nSome of the Neuromarketing studies used heart rate, as \none of the metrics to measure arousal and focus of the \nconsumer while they encounter TV commercial stimuli. \nHeart rate is the speed of the heartbeat and it is typically \nmeasured by electrocardiogram (EKG). An EKG meas-\nures the electrical activity of the heart using external skin \nelectrodes. Heart rate is controlled by two antagonistic \nnervous systems, i.e., the sympathetic nervous system \n(SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). \nAutomatic response to external stimuli is determined by \nthe sympathetic system of the body. Activation of this \n\n\n\nPage 11 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10  \n\nsystem increases heart rate, causing fight or flight mode, \nwhich is an independent measure of arousal [38]. In con-\ntrast, the calm and relaxed state characterized by slower \nheart rate is controlled by the parasympathetic system. \nSlower heart rate in response to an advertisement implies \nthe increased focus on the ad, hence provides an inde-\npendent measure of attention [38]. Another physiologi-\ncal parameter, skin conductance (SC), or galvanic skin \nresponse (GSR), develops when the skin acts as an elec-\ntrical conductor due to the increased activity of the sweat \nglands from exposure to stimulus [38]. Skin conductance \n\namplitude and response latency provide direct measures \nof arousal when watching TV commercials, unlike self-\nreported measures that are often based on later memory \nrecall. Although GSR cannot independently relate to \nemotional valence, some of the Neuromarketing studies, \ni.e., Cherubino et  al. [42], Çakar et  al. [34], Ungureanu \net al. [53], Magdin et al. [71], Goyal and Singh [54], and \nSingh et al. [56] have used skin conductance along with \nheart rate to measure the consumer attention and focus \non the TVC.\n\nFig. 1 Neural recording in Neuromarketing experiments: a multichannel EEG [43], b fMRI imaging [50], and c eye tracking for online booking \nappointment [48]\n\n\n\nPage 12 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10 \n\n3.4  Brain signal processing in Neuromarketing\nSince neural signals and images are highly vulnerable \nto noise and artifacts, before performing any analysis \nor interpretation it is imperative to preprocess the neu-\nral signals to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). \nNoises that commonly accompany the EEG signals \nare cardiac signals (ECG), power line interference, eye \nmovement artifact (EOG) and muscle movement arti-\nfacts (EMG). Preprocessing in Neuromarketing consists \nof filtering the signals to the frequency bands of inter-\nest, re-referencing the filtered signal to a common aver-\nage, detecting and interpolating bad channels, noise \nand artifact removal, and framing or segmentation for \nfurther machine learning process.\n\nEEG signals usually spread across its energy from \n0.5  Hz to around 90  Hz. For classification purpose, it \nis required to have energies only from the relevant fre-\nquency bands, hence EEG preprocessing commonly \nuses band pass filtering techniques. Band pass filter \nrequires two cutoff frequencies, one upper and one \nlower to pass the energy between them and blocks \nenergies from all other frequencies. Band pass filter \nused in these  Neuromarketing experiments  are basi-\ncally the digital version of the filter mostly applied by \nMATLAB and EEGLAB (a toolbox designated for EEG \nsignal processing in MATLAB). Re-referencing to a \ncommon average reference is also found common after \nband pass filtering in the studies of Yang et al. [41], Fan \nand Touyama [66] to reduce possible shifts from exter-\nnal artifacts. Power line interference is usually found \nremoved by using a notch filter at 60 Hz or 50 Hz.\n\nThe reviewed literatures had some common \napproaches in noise removal techniques. Since the noise \naccompanied with EEG signals are random in nature, \nsignal averaging is a common approach to reduce these \nnoises. Fan and Touyama [66] averaged the ERP signals \nfor noise removal. Chew et  al. [17] used ABM software \ndevelopment kit (SDK) in MATLAB to remove 5 types \nof artifacts, namely EMG, eye blinking artifact, excur-\nsions, saturations and spike. Excursion, saturation and \nspike artifacts in the EEG signals are replaced by zero val-\nues. Then they applied nearest neighbor interpolation to \nreplace those zero values. Another type of filter Savitzky–\nGolay is found in use by Yadava et  al. [18] for signal \nsmoothing. For noise and artifact removal, the  4th-order \nButterworth filter was used in the studies of Ogino and \nMitsukura [68] and Oon et al. [55].\n\nIndependent component analysis (ICA) is an approach \nto separate the statistical subcomponents of EEG sig-\nnals. ICA is found as the most sought after technique \nfor removing artifacts and noise from EEG signals in \nthese articles. Studies of Cherubino et al. [42], Bhardwaj \net al. [53], Venkatraman et al. [38], Pozharliev et al. [20], \n\nBoksem and Smitds[57], Wriessnegger et al. [29], Fan and \nTouyama [66], Pilelienė and Grigaliūnaitė [36] all used \nindependent component analysis mostly for eye blink \nand eye movement artifact, and muscular movement \nnoise removal.\n\nNeuromarketing with fMRI studies have a different \nmethod for image preprocessing. Since the fMRI provides \na 3D image of the brain region with time information, it \nis basically a 4D signal. A 4D dataset is motion corrected \nfor any head movement, slice time corrected, spatially \nnormalized and finally smoothed to recover a denoised \nfMRI image. Wang et al. [30] used statistical parametric \nmapping (SPM) software to preprocess their fMRI data. \nTheir raw fMRI signal was subjected to standard preproc-\nessing involving correction for head motion, slice timing \ncorrection, temporal and spatial denoising and normali-\nzation into standardized Montreal Neurological Institute \n(MNI) space. The mean fMRI signal from each region of \ninterest was extracted from voxels in a sphere of 6-mm \nradius centered at the activation point in the regional \nactivation map.\n\nfMRI scan was also used by Hubert et al. [25] in their \nexperiment on hedonic vs. prudent shopper based on \nconsumer impulsiveness. Decision-making process with \ncognitive deliberation and the consideration of long-\nterm consequences are associated with processing in \nbrain areas such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex \n(vmPFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). \nHence, these vmPFC and dlPFC were the region of inter-\nests to capture the BOLD activation imaging [62]. Brain \nactivation through BOLD signals was used by Hsu and \nCheng [26] to investigate negative emotion after prod-\nuct harm crisis. fMRI region of interest in this study \nincluded amygdala, left calcarine, striatum, ventral teg-\nmental area (VTA) and right insula. The amygdala is \nassociated with memory and subjective evaluation, left \ncalcarine relates to human visual processing, the striatum \nis associated with goal-oriented evaluation, and reward \nevaluation, VTA relates to decision-making process and \nmotive functions, and the insula regions are involved in \nconsumer decision-making related to negative reinforce-\nment. Acquiring activation within these regions affirms \nthe relation between stimuli and cognitive response.\n\nSignal detection and segmentation is the process by \nwhich the signal of interest is detected from the origi-\nnal signal and then separated for further procedures. \nThe energy of the signal may be used as a threshold \nfor detection of the signal. Often the Neuromarketing \nexperiments contain multiple types of stimuli shown \nto the test subjects. In such cases segmentation sepa-\nrates the event-based time signals for further pro-\ncessing, example Bhardwaj et  al. [58]. Segmentation \nor framing the EEG signals to a shorter time window \n\n\n\nPage 13 of 19Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.            (2020) 7:10  \n\nis mostly required to process the signal in time–fre-\nquency domain [58]. Cherubino et  al. [42] segmented \ntheir acquired and filtered EEG traces to extract the \ncerebral activity during the exposure to the market-\ning stimuli. Oon et al. [55] used 1-s segmentation time \nto extract non-linear detrended fluctuation analysis \nfeatures.\n\nThe goal of feature extraction is to find the set of \nfeature that minimizes intra-class variability and maxi-\nmizes inter-class variability. So we need to extract use-\nful information from the preprocessed signal, which \ncan be spatial, spectral or temporal [45]. As the EEG \nsignal is non-stationary, the feature extraction pro-\ncedure is quite often complicated. Discrete wavelet \ntransformation (DWT) is a viable way to extract fea-\ntures from EEG signals.\n\nYadava et  al. [18] performed DWT-based four-level \nwavelet analysis to extract features from their EEG sig-\nnals and decomposed the EEG signal into delta, theta, \nalpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. Another \nfeature extraction approach, principal component \nanalysis (PCA) was used by Venkatraman et  al. [38] \nfor extracting fMRI features in their Neuromarketing \nexperiment. In 2016, Fan and Touyama applied spatial \nand temporal principal component analysis (STPCA) \nfor feature extraction from ERP P300 signal. Rakshit \nand Lahiri [67] used a different approach to extract \nfeatures from EEG signals. They used Welch method \nfor one-sided power spectral density estimate and then \napplied a 256-point DFT algorithm on hamming win-\ndow of length 50 to extract features. Chew et  al. [17] \nadopted Hadjidimitriou and Hadjileontiadis methods \nin feature extraction where the feature estimation is \nbased on the event-related synchronization and desyn-\nchronization theory.\n\nFeature selection is also popularly known as dimen-\nsionality reduction or subset selection. This is a well-\nknown concept in machine learning which is about \nselecting an optimal set of features that decreases \ndimensionality, but has the most contribution to the \nclassification accuracy. In the past few years, feature \nselection has caught the attention of most research-\ners because of the nature of high dimensionality of \nbio-signals and the low number of sample data. Selec-\ntion of the optimal feature subset is always relative to \nan evaluation function. In most cases it is the evalua-\ntion function that measures the classification accu-\nracy. Feature selection techniques can be divided into \nthree categories, namely: filter, wrapper and embed-\nded approach. Wang et al. [30] used Recursive Cluster \nElimination (RCE) algorithm in spatiotemporal fMRI \nfeature selection. Soria Morillo et al. [40] used PCA for \nfeature reduction from their dataset. One-way analyses \n\nof variance (ANOVA) then cross-validation were also \nfound in use to identify the optimal feature set for cog-\nnitive or affective state classification by Yang et al. [41].\n\n3.5  Machine learning application in Neuromarketing\nUsing advanced neural recording method and signal pro-\ncessing tools, one can analyze EEG signals and interpret \ntheir correspondence with marketing stimuli. Frontal \nalpha asymmetry theory helped the researcher classify \nemotional approach/withdrawal response of the test sub-\njects using sub-band power of left and right hemispheric \nfrontal electrode [21]. However, classifying approach/\nwithdrawal or like/dislike without the FAA is possible, \neven possible from single electrode EEG signals. This \nrequires advanced Machine Learning algorithm appli-\ncation in Neuromarketing. Both supervised and unsu-\npervised learning methods were used in the following \nNeuromarketing experiments. Supervised learning in \nNeuromarketing uses a priori ground truth, usually the \ninterviewed response (like/dislike) from the test subjects \nas the labels. The labels help the classifier know the sig-\nnal pattern of like and dislike EEGs in the training data-\nsets. During the testing phase, like/dislike is predicted \nfrom a dataset without the labels. Researcher can hide \nthe training dataset labels from the classifier, and later \nuse it for accuracy calculation. On the other hand, unsu-\npervised learning approach used in Neuromarketing does \nnot require prior knowledge of the like/dislike labels. \nIt analyzes the signals with an aim to infer the existing \nstructures for different classes. Supervised learning usu-\nally solves either classification problem or a regression \nproblem. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, \nArtificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests \n(RF) are the most common supervised learning classifi-\ners in Neuromarketing. In parallel, unsupervised learning \nin Neuromarketing has prominently the clustering type \nclassifiers, such as K-NN (k-nearest neighbors), principal \ncomponent analysis, singular value decomposition, and \nindependent component analysis (ICA).\n\nNeuromarketing researches over the last 5 years mainly \ndealt with like/dislike classification problem and pre-\ndicting ",

Sarker1,2*\n\nIntroduction\nIn recent days, smartphones have become an essential part of our daily life and con-\nsidered as highly personal devices of individuals. These devices are also known as one \nof the most important IoT (Internet of Things) devices, because of their capabilities \nto interconnect their users with the Internet, and corresponding data processing [1]. \nSmartphones are also considered as “next generation, multifunctional cell phones that \nfacilitates data processing as well as enhanced wireless connectivity” [2]. The cellular net-\nwork coverage has reached 96.8% of the world population, and this number even reaches \n100% of the population in the developed countries [3]. In recent statistics, according to \nGoogle Trends [4] we have shown in Fig.  1, that users’ interest on “Mobile Phones” is \nmore and more than other platforms like “Desktop Computer”, “Laptop Computer” or \n\nAbstract \n\nSmartphones are considered as one of the most essential and highly personal devices \nof individuals in our current world. Due to the popularity of context-aware technol-\nogy and recent developments in smartphones, these devices can collect and process \nraw contextual data about users’ surrounding environment and their corresponding \nbehavioral activities with their phones. Thus, smartphone data analytics and building \ndata-driven context-aware systems have gained wide attention from both academia \nand industry in recent days. In order to build intelligent context-aware applications on \nsmartphones, effectively learning a set of context-aware rules from smartphone data \nis the key. This requires advanced data analytical techniques with high precision and \nintelligent decision making strategies based on contexts. In comparison to traditional \napproaches, machine learning based techniques provide more effective and efficient \nresults for smartphone data analytics and corresponding context-aware rule learning. \nThus, this article first makes a survey on previous work in the area of contextual smart-\nphone data analytics and then presents a discussion of challenges and future directions \nfor effectively learning context-aware rules from smartphone data, in order to build \nrule-based automated and intelligent systems.\n\nKeywords: Smartphone data, Machine learning, Data science, Clustering, \nClassification, Association, Rule learning, Personalization, Time-series, User behavior \nmodeling, Predictive analytics, Context-aware computing, Mobile and IoT services, \nIntelligent systems\n\nOpen Access\n\n© The Author(s) 2019.

Figure 1 represents timestamp \ninformation in terms of particular date in x-axis and corresponding search interests in \nthe range of 0 to 100 in terms of popularity relative to the highest point on the chart in \ny-axis. For instance, a value of 100 (maximum) in y-axis represents the peak popularity \nfor a particular term, while 0 (minimum) means the term was lowest in terms of popu-\nlarity [4].\n\nDue to the advanced features and recent developments in smartphones, these devices \ncan collect raw contextual data about users’ surrounding environment and their corre-\nsponding behavioral activities with their phones in a daily basis [5]. As a result, smart-\nphone data becomes a great source to understand users’ behavioral activity patterns in \ndifferent contexts, and to derive useful information, i.e., context-aware rules, for the pur-\npose of building rule-based intelligent context-aware systems. A context-aware rule has \ntwo parts, which follows “IF-THEN” logical structure to formulate [6]. The antecedent \npart represents users’ surrounding contextual information, e.g., temporal context, spa-\ntial context, social contexts, or others relevant contextual information and the conse-\nquent part represents their corresponding behavioral activities or usage. Let’s consider \nan example of a context-aware mobile notification management system for a smart-\nphone user Alice. A context-aware rule for such system could be “The user typically \ndismisses mobile notifications while at work; however, accepts the notifications in the \nevening from her family members, even though she is in work”. A set of such context-\naware behavioral rules including general and specific exceptions, may vary from user-to-\nuser according to their preferences. In addition to the personalized services mentioned \nabove, the relevant context-aware rules in different surrounding contexts could be appli-\ncable to other broad application areas, like context-aware  software and IoT services, \nintelligent eHealth services, and context-aware smart city services, intelligent cybersecu-\nrity services etc. utilizing the relevant contextual data of that particular domain. Overall, \nthis study is typically for those data science and machine learning researchers, and prac-\ntitioners who particularly want to work on data-driven intelligent context-aware systems \nand services based on machine learning rules.\n\nEffectively learning context-aware rules from smartphone data is challenging because \nof many reasons, ranging from understanding raw data to applications. A number of \nresearch [7–9] has been done on mining context-aware rules from smartphone data for \nvarious purposes. However, to effectively learn such rules for the purpose of building \n\nFig. 1 Users’ interest trends over time, where x-axis and y-axis represent a particular timestamp and \ncorresponding search interests in numeric values in terms of world-wide popularity respectively\n\n\n\nPage 3 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\nintelligent context-aware systems, a deeper analysis in contextual data patterns and \nlearning according to individuals’ usage is needed. Thus, advanced data analysis based \non machine learning techniques, can be used to make effective and efficient decision-\nmaking capabilities in different context-aware test cases for smartphones. Several \nmachine learning and data mining techniques, such as contextual data clustering, fea-\nture optimization and selection, rule-based classification and association analysis, incre-\nmental learning for dynamic updating and management, and corresponding rule-based \nprediction model can be designed to provide smartphone data analytic solutions. The \nreason is that such machine learning techniques can be more accurate, and more precise \nfor analyzing huge amount of contextual data. The aim of these advanced analytic tech-\nniques is to discover information, hidden patterns, and unknown correlations among the \ncontexts and eventually generate context-aware rules. For instance, a detailed analysis \nof time-series data and corresponding data clustering based on similar behavioral pat-\nterns, could lead to capture the diverse behaviors of an individual’s activities, thereby \nenabling more optimal time-based context-aware rules than the traditional approaches \n[10]. Thus, intelligent data-driven decisions using machine learning techniques can \nprofit better decision making capability over the traditional approaches while consider-\ning the multi-dimensional contexts.\n\nBased on our survey and analysis on existing research, little work has been done in \nterms of how machine learning techniques significantly impact on contextual smart-\nphone data and to learn corresponding context-aware rules. To address this short-\ncoming, this article first makes a survey on previous work in the area of contextual \nsmartphone data analytics in several perspectives involved in context-aware rules, such \nas time-series modeling that is also known as a discretization of temporal context, rule \ndiscovery techniques, and incremental learning and rule updation techniques, which has \nbeen highlighted in our earlier work [6]. After that this article presents a brief discussion \non challenges and future directions to overcome these issues. Based on our discussion, \nfinally we suggest a machine learning based context-aware rule learning framework for \nthe purpose of effectively learning context-aware rules from smartphone data, in order \nto build rule-based automated and intelligent systems.\n\nThe contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.\n\n• We first make a brief survey on previous work in the area of smartphone data analyt-\nics in several perspectives related to context-aware rule learning and summarize the \nshortcomings of these research.\n\n• We then present a brief discussion on the challenges and future directions to over-\ncome the issues to learn context-aware rules from smartphone data.\n\n• Finally, we suggest a machine learning based context-aware rule learning framework \nand briefly discuss the role of various layers associated with the framework, for the \npurpose of building rule-based intelligent context-aware systems.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first article surveying context-aware rule learn-\ning strategies from smrtphone data. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. \n“Background: contexts and smartphone data” section presents background information \non contexts and contextual smartphone data. “Context-aware rule learning strategies” \n\n\n\nPage 4 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\nsection  surveys previous work in various perspectives related to context-aware rule \nlearning. “Challenges and future directions” section briefly discusses the challenges and \nfuture directions of research regarding context-aware rule learning from smartphone \ndata. In “Suggested machine learning based framework” section we suggest a machine \nlearning based context-aware rule learning framework and discuss various layers with \ntheir roles while learning rules. Context-aware rule based applications section summa-\nrizes a number of real world applications based on context-aware rules. Finally, “Conclu-\nsion” section concludes this paper.\n\nBackground: contexts and smartphone data\nThis section reviews background information on the main characteristics of contexts \nand contextual smartphone data that address learning context-aware rules for the pur-\npose of building rule-based intelligent systems.\n\nCharacteristics of contexts\n\nThe term context can be used with a variety of different meanings in different purposes. \nThe notion of context has been used in numerous areas, including Pervasive and Ubiq-\nuitous Computing, Human Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported Collaborative \nWork, and Ambient Intelligence [11]. In this section, first we briefly review what is con-\ntext in the area of mobile and context-aware computing. In Ubiquitous and Pervasive \nComputing area, early works on context-awareness referred to context as primarily \nthe location of people and objects [12]. In recent works, context has been extended to \ninclude a broader collection of factors, such as physical and social aspects of an entity, \nas well as the activities of users [11]. Having examined the definitions and categories of \ncontext given by the pervasive and ubiquitous computing community, this section seeks \nto define our view of context within the scope of smartphone data analytics. As the defi-\nnitions of context to pervasive and ubiquitous computing area are also broad, this dis-\ncussion is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.\n\nSeveral studies have attempted to define and represent the context from different \nperspectives. For instance, the user’s location information, the surrounding people and \nobjects around the user, and the changes to those objects are considered as contexts by \nSchilit et al. [12]. Brown et al. [13] also define contexts as user’s locational information, \ntemporal information, the surrounding people around the user, temperature, etc. Simi-\nlarly, the user’s locational information, environmental information, temporal informa-\ntion, user’s identity, are also taken into account as contexts by Ryan et  al. [14]. Other \ndefinitions of context have simply provided synonyms for context such as context as the \nenvironment or social situation. A number of researchers are taken into account the \ncontext as the environmental information of the user. For instance, in [15], the environ-\nmental information that the user’s computer knows about are taken into account as con-\ntext by Brown et al., whereas the social situation of the user is considered as a context \nin Franklin et al. [16]. On the other hand, a number of other researchers consider it to \nbe the environment related to the applications. For instance, Ward et al. [17] consider \nthe state of the surrounding information of the applications as contexts. Hull et al. [18] \ndefine context as the aspects of the current situation of the user and include the entire \n\n\n\nPage 5 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\nenvironment. The settings of applications are also treated as context in Rodden et  al. \n[19].\n\nAccording to Schilit et  al. [20] the important aspects of context are: (i) where you \nare, (ii) whom you are with, and (iii) what resources are nearby. The information of the \nchanging environment is taken into account as context in their definition. In addition to \nthe user environment (e.g., user location, nearby people around the user, and the cur-\nrent social situation of the user), they also include the computing environment and the \nphysical environment. For instance, connectivity, available processors, user input and \ndisplay, network capacity, and costs of computing can be the examples of the computing \nenvironment, while the noise level, temperature, the lighting level, can be the examples \nof the physical environment. Dey et al. [21] present a survey of alternative view of con-\ntext, which are largely imprecise and indirect, typically defining context by synonym or \nexample. Finally, they offer the following definition of context, which is perhaps now the \nmost widely accepted. According to Dey et al. [21] “Context is any information that can \nbe used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is person, place or object \nthat is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, includ-\ning the user and the application themselves”. Thus, based on the definition of Dey et al. \n[21], we can define context in the scope of this work as “Context is any information that \ncan be used to characterize users’ day-to-day situations that have an influence on their \nsmartphone usage”. An example of relevant contexts could be temporal context, spatial \ncontext, or social context etc. that might have an influence to make individuals’ diverse \ndecisions on smartphone usage in their daily life activities.\n\nContextual smartphone data\n\nWe live in the age of data [22], where everything that surrounds us is linked to a data \nsource and everything in our lives is captured digitally. Mobile or cellular phones have \nbecome increasingly ubiquitous and powerful to log user diverse activities for under-\nstanding their preferences and phone usage behavior. For instance, smart mobile phones \nhave the ability to log various types of context data related to a user’s phone call activities \nabout when the user makes outgoing calls, or accepts, rejects, and misses the incoming \ncalls [23–26]. In addition to such call related meta data, other dimensions of contex-\ntual information such as user location [27], user’s day-to-day situation [28], the social \nrelationship between the caller an callee identified by the individual’s unique phone \ncontact number [29] are also recorded by the smart mobile phones. Thus, call log data \ncollected by the smart mobile phone can be used as a context source to modeling indi-\nvidual mobile phone user behavior in smart context-aware mobile communication sys-\ntems [30]. In addition to voice communication, short message service (SMS) is known \nas text communication service allows the exchange of short text messages of individual \nmobile phone users, using standardized communications rules or protocols. According \nto the International Telecommunication Union [31], short messages have become a mas-\nsive commercial industry, worth over 81 billion dollars globally. The numerous growth \nin the number of mobile phone users in the world has lead to a dramatic increasing of \nspam messages [32]. The SMS log contains all the message including the spam and non-\nspam text messages [32, 33], which can be used in the task of automatic spam filtering \n[25, 32], or predicting good time or bad time to deliver such messages [33].\n\n\n\nPage 6 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\nWith the rapid development of smartphones, people use these devices for using vari-\nous categories of apps such as Multimedia, Facebook, Gmail, Youtube, Skype, Game [9, \n34]. Thus, smartphone apps log contains these usage with relevant contextual informa-\ntion [8, 9, 35–37]. Such logs can be used for mining the contextual behavioral patterns of \nindividual mobile phone users that is, which app is preferred by a particular user under \na certain context to provide personalized context-aware recommendation. In the real \nworld, a variety of smart mobile applications use notifications in order to inform the \nusers about various kinds of events, news or just to send them reminders or alerts. For \ninstance, the notifications of inviting games on social networks, social or promotional \nemails, or a number of predictive suggestions by various smart phone applications, \ne.g., Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIN, WhatsApp, Viver, Skype, Youtube [7]. The extracted \ncontextual patterns from smartphone notification logs can be used to build intelligent \nmobile notification management systems according to their preferences.\n\nUser navigation in the web in another major activities of individual users. Thus, web \nlog contains the information about user mobile web navigation, web searching, e-mail, \nentertainment, chat, misc, news, TV, netting, travel, sport, banking, and related contex-\ntual information [38–40]. Mining contextual usage patterns from such log data, can be \nused to make accurate context-aware predictions about user navigation and to adapt the \nportal structure according to the needs of users. Similarly, game log contains the infor-\nmation about playing various types such games such as action, adventure, casual, puzzle, \nRPG, strategy, sports etc. of individual mobile phone users, and related contextual infor-\nmation [41]. The extracted contextual patterns from such logs data, can be used to build \npersonalized mobile game recommendation system for individual mobile phone users \naccording to their own preferences.\n\nThe ubiquity of smart mobile phones and their computing capabilities for various real \nlife purposes provide an opportunity of using these devices as a life-logging device, i.e., \npersonal e-memories [42]. In a more technical sense, life-logs sense and store individ-\nual’s contextual information from their surrounding environment through a variety of \nsensors available in their smart mobile phones, which are the core components of life-\nlogs such as user phone calls, SMS headers (no content), App use (e.g., Skype, What-\nsapp, Youtube etc.), physical activities form Google play API, and related contextual \ninformation such as WiFi and Bluetooth devices in user’s proximity, geographical loca-\ntion, temporal information [42]. The extracted contextual patterns or behavioral rules of \nindividual mobile phone users utilizing such life log data, can be used to improve user \nexperience in their daily life. In addition to these personalized log data, smartphones are \nalso capable for collecting and processing IoT data [1]. Based on such smartphone data \nhaving contextual information, in this paper, we briefly review the existing rule learn-\ning strategies and discuss the open challenges and opportunities by highlighting future \ndirections for context-aware rule learning.\n\nContext‑aware rule learning strategies\nIn this section, we review existing strategies related to learning rules based on contex-\ntual information in various perspectives. This includes time-series modeling that cre-\nates behavioral data clusters for generating temporal context based rules, contextual rule \n\n\n\nPage 7 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\ndiscovery by taking into account multi-dimensional contexts, such as temporal, spatial \nor social contexts, and incremental learning to dynamic updating of rules.\n\nModeling time‑series smartphone data\n\nTime is the most important context that impacts on mobile user behavior for making \ndecisions [38]. Individual’s behaviors vary over time in the real world and the mobile \nphones record the exact time of all diverse activities of the users with their mobile \nphones. A time series is a sequence of data points ordered in time [43]. However, to use \nsuch time-series data into behavioral rules, an effective modeling of temporal context \nis needed. Thus, time-series segmentation becomes one of the research focuses in this \nstudy as exact time in mobile phone data is not very informative to mine behavioral rules \nof individual mobile phone users. According to [44], time-based behavior modeling is an \nopen problem. Hence, we summarize the existing time-series segmentation approaches \n\nTable 1 Various types of static time segments used in different applications\n\nTime interval type Number \nof segments\n\nUsed time interval and segment details References\n\nEqual 3 Morning [7:00–12:00], afternoon [13:00–18:00] and \nevening [19:00–24:00]\n\nSong et al.

In order to generate segments, \nrecently, most of the researchers (shown in Table 1) take into account only the temporal \ncoverage (24-h-a-day) and statically segment time into arbitrary categories (e.g., morn-\ning) or periods (e.g., 1 h). Such static segmentation of time mainly focuses on time inter-\nvals. According to [45], there are mainly two types of time intervals: one is equal and \nanother one is unequal. For instance, four different time segments, i.e., morning [6:00–\n12:00], afternoon [12:00–18:00], evening [18:00–24:00] and night [0:00–6:00] can be an \nexample of equal interval based segmentation because of their same interval length. On \nthe other hand, another four time slots such as morning [6:00–12:00], afternoon [12:00–\n16:00], evening [16:00–20:00] and night [20:00–24:00 and 0:00–6:00] can be an example \nof unequal interval based segmentation. For this example, different lengths of time inter-\nval are used to do the segmentation. In Table 1, we have summarized a number of works \nthat use static segmentation considering either equal or unequal time interval in various \npurposes.\n\nAlthough, various time intervals and corresponding segmentation summarized in \nTable 1 are used in different purposes, these approaches take into account a fixed num-\nber of segments for all users. However, while performing such segmentation users’ behav-\nioral evidence that differs from user-to-user over time in the real world, is not taken into \naccount. Thus, these static generation of segments may not suitable for producing high \nconfidence temporal rules for individual smartphone users. For instance, N1 number \nof segments might give meaningful results for one case, while N2 number of segments \ncould give better results for another case, where N1  = N2 . Therefore, a dynamic segmen-\ntation of time rather than statically generation could be able to reflect individuals’ behav-\nioral evidence over time and can play a role to produce high confidence rules according \nto their usage records.\n\nDynamic segmentation\n\nAs discussed above, a segmentation technique that generates variable number of seg-\nments would be more meaningful to model users’ behavior. Thus, dynamic segmenta-\ntion technique rather than static segmentation can be used in order to achieve the goal. \nIn a dynamic segmentation, the number of segments are not fixed and predefined; may \nchange depending on their behavioral characteristics, patterns or preferences. Several \ndynamic segmentation techniques in terms of generating variable number of segments \nexist for modeling users’ behavioral activities in temporal contexts. A number of authors \nsimply take into account a single parameter, e.g., interval length or base period, to gener-\nate the segments. The number of time segments varies according to this period. If Tmax \nrepresents the whole time period of 24-h-a-day and BP is a base period, then the num-\nber of segments will be Tmax/BP [10]. If the base period increases, the number of time \nsegments decreases and vice-versa. For instance, if the base period is 5 min, then the \nnumber of segments will be the division result of 24-h-a-day and 5. In this example, a \n\n\n\nPage 9 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\nbase period, e.g., 5 min, is assumed as the finest granularity to distinguish day-to-day \nactivities of an individual. If the base period incremented to 15 min, then the number \nof segments decreases, where 15 min can be assumed as the finest granularity. Thus the \nnumber of segments varies based on the base time period. Similarly, individuals’ calen-\ndar schedules and corresponding time boundaries can also be used to determine var-\niable length of time segments, in order to model users’ behavior in temporal context, \nwhich may vary according to users’ preferences [59]. For instance, one user may have a \nparticular event between 1 and 2 p.m., while another may have in another time bound-\nary between 1:30 and 2:30 p.m.. Thus, the time segmentation varies according to their \ndaily life activities scheduled in their personal calendars. Similarly, multiple thresholds, \nsliding window, data shape based approaches are used in several applications, shown \nin Table 2. In addition to these approaches, a number of authors use machine learning \ntechniques such as clustering, genetic algorithm etc. In Table  2, we have summarized \na number of works that use such type of dynamic segmentation techniques in various \npurposes.\n\nClustering highlighted in Table  2 is one of the important machine learning tech-\nniques in forming large time segments where certain user behavior patterns are taken \ninto account. Usually, clustering algorithms are designed with certain assumptions and \nfavor certain type of problems. In this sense, it is not accurate to say ‘best’ in the con-\ntext of clustering algorithms; it depends on specific application [75]. Among the cluster-\ning algorithms the K-means algorithm is the best-known squared error-based clustering \nalgorithm [76]. However, this algorithm needs to specify the initial partitions and fixed \nnumber of clusters K. The convergence centroids also vary with different initial points. \nSometimes this algorithm is influenced by outliers because of mean value calculation. \n\nTable 2 Various types of dynamic time segments used in different applications\n\nBase technique Description References\n\nSingle parameter A predefined value of time interval, e.g., 15 min \nis used to generate segments\n\nOzer et al.

[62]\n\nA relatively large value of the parameter, e.g., \n2-h is used to generate time segments\n\nKaratzoglou et al.

[74]\n\n\n\nPage 10 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\nMore importantly, the characteristic of this algorithm might not be directly applicable \nfor the purpose of learning  context-aware rules. The reason is that users’ behave dif-\nferently in different contexts, which also may vary from user-to-user in the real world. \nThus, it’s difficult to assume a number of clusters K to capture their diverse behaviors \neffectively. Another similar K-medoids method [77] is more robust than K-means algo-\nrithm in the presence of outliers because a medoid is less influenced by outliers than a \nmean. Though it minimizes the outlier problem but the other characteristic mismatches \nexist between K-means and the problem of time-series modeling.\n\nAs the size and number of time segments depend on the user’s behavior and it differs \nfrom user-to-user, a bottom-up hierarchical data processing can help to make behavioral \nclusters. Existing hierarchical algorithms are mainly classified as agglomerative methods \nand device methods. However, the device clustering method is not commonly used in \npractice [75]. The simplest and most popular agglomerative clustering is single linkage \n[78] and complete linkage [79]. Another method, nearest neighbor [75], is also similar to \nthe single linkage agglomerative clustering algorithm. All these hierarchical algorithms \nuse a proximity matrix which is generated by computing the distance between a new \ncluster and other clusters. Then according to the matrix value these algorithms succes-\nsively merge the clusters until the desired cluster structure is obtained. However, it is \nnot possible to predict the level at which the merging is best according to a proximity \nmatrix because of the variations in users’ behavior. Thus applying such clustering tech-\nniques could generate the segments according to users’ behavioral patterns available in \ntime-series. Similarly, genetic algorithm based approaches shown in Table  2 also pro-\nduce dynamic segments.\n\nIn a summary, we can conclude that time-series modeling in terms of both static seg-\nmentation and dynamic segmentation approaches discussed above, are able to generate \nvarious time segments that can be used in different purposes. However, the above time-\nseries modeling approaches do not necessarily map to the patterns of individuals’ usage \naccording to their preferences, which is based on users’ diverse behaviors over time-of-\nthe-week and may vary from user to user. A machine learning based behavior-oriented \ndynamic time-series modeling technique by taking into account such patterns, could be \nsignificant in order to effectively use temporal context as the basis for discovering rules \ncapturing smartphone usage behavior.\n\nRule discovery\n\nAnother major issue focus in this study is discovering useful behavioral rules of individ-\nual mobile phone users based on multi-dimensional contexts, such as temporal, spatial, \nor social contexts, utilizing their smartphone data. In the area of machine learning both \nassociation rule learning [80] and classification rule learning [81] are the most common \ntechniques to discover such type of rules of individual mobile phone users. In the follow-\ning, we give an brief overview of both association and classification techniques for the \npurpose of discovering rules based on multi-dimensional contexts.\n\n\n\nPage 11 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\nAssociation rules\n\nAssociation rule learning algorithm discovers association rules that satisfy the prede-\nfined minimum support and confidence constraints from a given dataset [80]. Many \nassociation rule learning algorithms have been proposed in the data mining literature, \nsuch as logic based [82], frequent pattern based [80, 83, 84], tree-based [85] etc. Asso-\nciation rule learning technique is well defined in terms of rule’s performance, e.g., accu-\nracy, and flexibility as it has the own parameter support and confidence [86]. A number \nof researchers [7–9] have used association rule learning technique (e.g., Apriori) [80] \nto mine rules capturing mobile phone users’ behavior. However, the existing  associa-\ntion rule learning techniques might not be suitable for discovering users’ behavioral \nrules because of several reasons. In the following, we summarize the drawbacks of asso-\nciation rules for discovering the behavioral rules of individual mobile phone users by \ntaking into account multi-dimensional contexts.\n\nLacking in understanding the impact of contexts Different contexts in mobile phone \ndata, such as temporal, spatial or social context, may have different impact or influence \non the behavioral rules of individual mobile phone users. For instance, incoming phone \ncalls from a significant person, e.g., mother, is always answered by an individual, even \nthough she is in a meeting because of her family priority. In this case, the importance \nof social relationship between individuals ( social relationship → mother ) in making \nbehavioral decision, is higher than other relevant contexts such as time period, weekday \nor holiday, location, accompany with etc. However, the typical association rule learn-\ning technique implicitly assumes all the contexts in the datasets have the similar nature, \nand/or impact while discovering rules based on multi-dimensional contexts.\n\nRedundancy Association rule learning technique, e.g., Apriori, discovers all the con-\ntextual associations in a given dataset, if it satisfies the user preference, specified as \nminimum support value and minimum confidence value. As a result, association rule \nlearning technique produces a huge number of redundant rules as it does not take into \naccount the usefulness of a particular context or corresponding patterns while produc-\ning the associations. For instance, it produces up to 83% redundant rules for a given \ndataset that makes the rule-set unnecessarily large [87]. Therefore, it is very difficult to \ndetermine the most interesting ones among the huge amount of rules generated. As a \nresult, it makes the rule-based decision making process ineffective and more complex, \nwhich is not effective to build a context-aware intelligent system [88].\n\nComputational complexity and high training time In order to produce rules, associ-\nation rule learning technique takes huge amount of training time. For instance, in an \nexperimental study in mobile phone domain, the authors observe a high running time \nspanning several hours when the association rule learning algorithm is used to discover \nuser behavioral rules [8]. The main reason for taking high training time is that typical \nassociation techniques compute all the possible associations among contexts and are \nunable to filter the interesting rules that can be used to make effective decisions. As a \nresult the unnecessary generation of patterns increases the computational complexity \nand training time.\n\nIn a summary, by taking into account the impact of contexts, redundancy problem \nwhile generating rules, and computational complexity, typical association rule learning \n\n\n\nPage 12 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\ntechniques may not suitable to produce users’ behavioral rules in multi-dimensional \ncontexts, for the purpose of building intelligent context-aware systems.\n\nClassification rules\n\nClassification is another technique to discover user behavioral rules from the datasets. \nSeveral classification algorithms exist with the ability of rule generation like ZeroR [89], \nOneR [90], RIDOR [89], RIPPER [91], PART [92], DTNB [93], Decision Trees [81, 94] \netc. Among these techniques, decision tree is one of the most popular rule-based clas-\nsification algorithms as it has several advantages, such as easier to interpret; the ability \nto handle high dimensional data; simplicity and speed; good accuracy; and the ability to \ngenerate human understandable classification rules [95, 96]. In particular, a number of \nauthors [67, 97–100] have used decision tree classification technique to discover rules \ncapturing mobile phone users’ behavior for various purposes. However, the exisitng rule-\nbased classification techniques might not be suitable to model users’ behavior because of \nseveral reasons. In the following, we summarize the drawbacks of rule-based classifica-\ntion techniques for discovering the behavioral rules of individual mobile phone users in \nmulti-dimensional contexts.\n\nLow reliability In general, reliability refers the quality of being trustworthy or of per-\nforming consistently well. A pattern or rule is called reliable, if the relationship described \nby the pattern occurs in a high percentage of applicable cases. According to Geng et al. \n[101], a classification rule will be reliable, if it gives high prediction accuracy, and an \nassociation rule will be reliable, if it has high confidence that is associated to the accu-\nracy. However, the classification rules discovered by the typical rule-based classifica-\ntion techniques, e.g., decision trees, mostly have low reliability in many cases [7, 102]. \nAccording to Freitas et al. [86], a classification rule may not ensure a high accuracy in \npredictions. The reason is that it may has over-fitting problem and inductive bias, which \ndecrease the prediction accuracy of a machine learning based model.\n\nLacking in flexibility Traditional rule-based classification techniques, e.g., decision \ntrees, have no flexibility to set users’ preferences and consequently it makes rigid decision \nfor a particular test case [81]. However, rigid decision in modeling user behavior might \nnot be meaningful by considering real-world cases. The reason is that individuals’ pref-\nerences are not static in the real word; may vary from user-to-user [103]. For instance, \none individual may want the phone call agent to decline the incoming calls where she \ndid not answer the calls more than, say, 80% of the time in the past. For another person, \nthis preference could be 95% of the time according to her preference. Thus considering \nflexibility in users’ preferences while modeling their behavior could be another issue for \nmaking meaningful decisions in various context-aware test cases. \n\nLacking in generalization Typically, generality measures the comprehensiveness of a \npattern or rule, that is, the fraction of all the relevant records in the dataset that matches \nthe pattern. According to Geng et  al. [101], if a pattern characterizes more informa-\ntion in the relevant dataset, it tends to be more useful and interesting. Traditional clas-\nsification techniques consider data-driven generalization while producing classification \nrules. Besides this, users’ behavior-oriented generalization might be interested for learn-\ning context-aware rules. For instance, users’ behavior might be similar for a collection \nof contexts and have exceptions only in few cases [6]. Thus, users’ behavior oriented \n\n\n\nPage 13 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\ngeneralization could give more precise results for modeling their usage behavior. The \ngeneralization not only simplifies the resultant machine learning based model but also \nminimizes the over-fitting problem and improves the prediction accuracy.\n\nIn a summary, by taking into account the reliability, flexibility, and generalization dis-\ncussed above, typical classification rule learning techniques may not be suitable to pro-\nduce users’ behavioral rules in multi-dimensional contexts, for the purpose of building \nintelligent context-aware systems.\n\nIncremental learning and updating\n\nIn the area of data mining, a number of updating techniques, known as incremental rule \nmining, have been proposed for discovering rules in a dynamic database. These tech-\nniques use existing discovered rules and the incremental part of the dataset to get a com-\nplete updated set of rules. For instance, FUP algorithm proposed by Cheung et al. [104] \nis the first incremental updating technique for maintaining association rules when new \ndata are inserted to database. The FUP algorithm is based on Apriori [80] algorithm and \nis used to discover the new frequent itemsets in a dynamic database. In [105], Cheung \net al. propose a new algorithm FUP2 which is an extension of FUP algorithm. Another \nincremental association rule mining algorithm is proposed by Xu et al. [106]. They pro-\npose an IFP-tree technique which is an extension of FP-tree [85]. Thomas et  al. [107] \npropose an algorithm based on the concept of negative border which maintains both \nfrequent itemsets and border itemsets.\n\nA few number of algorithms [108, 109] are proposed based on three-way decision that \nis an extension of the commonly used binary-decision model with an added third option. \nA theory of three-way decision is constructed based on the notions of acceptance, rejec-\ntion and no commitment proposed by Yao et al. [110]. In [111], Amornchewin et al. pro-\npose a probability-based incremental association rule discovery algorithm. Thusaranon \net  al. [112] propose another probability-based incremental association rule discovery \nalgorithm that is an extension work of the algorithm introduced by Amornchewin and \nKreesuradej [111].\n\nThe above incremental mining techniques mainly take into account the faster process-\ning, e.g., efficiency, of overall mining process. While processing, these techniques reduce \nthe scanning on the given datasets by mining the incremental part separately, instead of \nprocessing the merged dataset that includes the initial dataset and the incremental part. \nThus, the overall mining process of such traditional updating techniques reflects on the \nprocessing time to discover a complete set of updated rules. However, to model users’ \nbehavior the freshness of rules, e.g., rules based on recent patterns are significant, which \nhas not been taken into account in these techniques. The reason is that users’ behav-\nior are not static in the real world; may change over time. Thus, the updation in terms \nof freshness in users’ behavior while producing rules are needed to effectively modeling \nsmartphone users’ behavior in relevant multi-dimensional contexts.\n\nIn order to produce rules according to the current behavior of an individual, a number \nof researchers use the behavioral patterns of recent mobile phone log data to predict \nthe future behavior than the patterns derived from the entire historical logs. However, \nthey use a static period of recent historical data that might not meaningful for discover-\ning users’ recent behavioral rules. For instance, Lee et al. [113] have studied the mobile \n\n\n\nPage 14 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\nphone users’ calling patterns and design a call recommendation algorithm for an adap-\ntive speed-call list using a recent call list data. In their approach, they extract call logs \nfor previous three months to achieve their goal. In order to predict the outgoing calls, \nBarzaiq et al. [114] propose an approach that analyzes mobile phone historical data from \na period of two years and observe relatively additional computational load which seems \nto be unnecessary. Phithakkitnukoon et  al. [115], conduct their study on reality min-\ning datasets that were collected over the period of nine months and observe that only \na recent portion of communication history is more significant. In another work, Phith-\nakkitnukoon et al. [116] present a model for predicting phone calls for the next twenty \nfour hours based on the users’ past communication history. In their approach, they \nhave shown that the recent trend of the user’s calling pattern is more significant than \nthe order one and has higher correlation to the future pattern than the pattern derived \nfrom the entire historical data. As such, the latest sixty days call records in the call logs \nare assumed to be the future observed call activities in order to get better prediction \naccuracy [116]. However, such static period of time consideration may not be suitable to \nreflect one’ current behavior, as users’ behaviors are not consistent in the real world; may \nvary from user-to-user over time.\n\nBesides these approaches, a number of authors [117, 118] deal with the problem of \nmanaging personal information, such as individual’s contact lists in their mobile phone, \nmore specifically, the task of searching the desirable contact number when making an \noutgoing call. According to Bergman et al. [117], a number of contacts in mobile phones \nare never actually used albeit the contact lists become increasingly bigger. Their experi-\nmental results show that 47% of the contacts of the users had not been used for over \nsix months or had never been used at all. To predict future behavior, Stefanis et al. [118], \nhave used window based model for managing and searching of personal information \non mobile phones. In their experiment, they have shown that the training window for \npredicting individual’s mobile phone usages behavior should be long enough to provide \nsufficient data. However, at the same time, a training window of more than two weeks \nwould likely fail to capture the dynamic changes in the behavioral patterns for making \nphone calls. In Addition, a training window of less than seven days would fail to capture \nthe behavioral changes for all the days-of-the-week including a change of social circum-\nstances in the weekends.\n\nIn a summary, by taking into account the freshness in rules reflecting users’ current \nbehavior and their dynamic updation, typical updating techniques discussed above may \nnot be suitable to produce a complete set of users’ behavioral rules in multi-dimensional \ncontexts, for the purpose of building intelligent context-aware systems, in order to pro-\nvide relevant services to the end smartphone users.\n\nChallenges and future directions\nWith the rapid development of smartphones, IoT, data science and machine learning, \nand context-aware computing, the most fundamental challenge is to explore contex-\ntual data collected from relevant sources and to extract context-aware rules for future \nactions. We highlight and analyze the main challenges in extracting rules, machine \nlearning techniques, and context-aware system areas, involved in context-aware rule \nlearning. We also discuss about the future directions to overcome such issues. Thus, this \n\n\n\nPage 15 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\nsection examines the impact of learning context-aware rules on several perspectives dis-\ncussed in this paper, in the broad area of smartphone data analytics. In the following, the \nchallenges and corresponding future directions are discussed briefly.\n\nIn the area of context aware computing, a number of approaches exist in order to \nhandle the continuous contextual features like time-series and to develop time-based \ncontext-aware systems. They are mostly designed by taking into account several categor-\nical time periods with a particular interval either equal or unequal, and corresponding \ntemporal rule based system. Although, a static modeling of temporal context is easy to \nunderstand and can be useful to analyze population behavior comparing across users, \na machine learning based data-driven solution could be an effective way. The reason is \nthat we are now in the age of data science and have available real world contextual data-\nsets in time order due to the rapid growing of IoT and smartphones. Thus, time-series \nmodeling becomes an open problem for building a context-aware system. Although, a \nfew number of learning techniques are employed to create data-driven temporal seg-\nments, they can be improved with advanced data analysis like observing variations in \ntemporal patterns, relation with individuals and population behavior, data sparseness in \ntime-series, synchronizing temporal context with multiple data sources etc. Improved \nmachine learning techniques or hybrid methods could give better results for modeling \nsuch continuous contextual data. For instance, a dynamic behavior-oriented aggregation \nalgorithm [10], could produce better time-series segmentation results for the purpose of \nmodeling time-based user behavior. New machine learning solutions by considering the \nabove mentioned perspectives can be designed and developed to process and analyze \nreal-world time-series data, in order to build an intelligent time-based context-aware \nsystem.\n\nIn addition to temporal context, additional dimensions of contexts might have the \nimpact on context-aware system. Although, association analysis and rule-based classi-\nfication analysis are the well known approaches in machine learning to discover rules, \nstill there are some issues to learn context-aware rules using these techniques. For \ninstance, an association learning technique produces a large amount of redundant rules \nthat makes the context-aware system complex and ineffective. On the otherhand, clas-\nsification techniques produce rules for rigid decision making that becomes non-reliable \nin many context-aware cases. Thus, effectively learning rules based on multi-dimen-\nsional contexts becomes another challenge. Although, both the classification and asso-\nciation analysis are well established methods in the area of machine learning, improved \nmachine learning techniques or hybrid methods could give better results for learning \neffective rules based on multi-dimensional contexts. For instance, the problem of redun-\ndancy while generating the association rules can be minimized by taking into account \nthe precedence of contexts [119]. Thus, advanced functionality and their combinations \nin machine learning, like the precedence of contexts, optimum contextual feature selec-\ntion, users’ preference-oriented discovery, generalization, abnormality or  exceptional \ndiscovery etc. could produce more effective rules. New machine learning based solu-\ntions or potential hybrid methods by considering these functionalities can be designed \nand developed to process and analyze real-world contextual data, in order to build a \nrule-based intelligent context-aware system that behaves accordingly.\n\n\n\nPage 16 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\nIn recent days, rule-based context-aware systems become popular due to the rapid \ngrowing of IoT and smartphones. Some of them are static rule based system particularly \ndesigned and developed according to the current needs. A number of such rule based \ncontext-aware systems are designed by taking into account rules discovered from data \nusing association learning or classification learning techniques. Although, these rule-\nbased systems are capable to provide the relevant services, still there is a lack of system \neffectiveness in terms of prediction accuracy in a human-centric system. In that case, \na machine learning based data-driven solution by taking into account incremental data \nand corresponding learning could be an effective way. The reason is that human behavior \nchanges over time and the most recent pattern is likely to be more significant than older \nones, which can be found from incremental data. Thus, recent patterns based modeling \nbecomes another challenge for building a context-aware system. Although, a number \nof updating techniques are employed in the area of incremental data mining, they can \nbe improved by taking into account the freshness in behavioral analytics for a particu-\nlar context. For instance, a very recent work RecencyMiner [120], could produce bet-\nter prediction results by taking into account recency-based updation for the purpose of \nmodeling user behavior. Thus, new machine learning technique or hybrid learning based \nsolutions by considering advanced functionalities like analyzing dynamic log, behav-\nioral patterns changing, context-aware incremental learning, freshness in rules, can be \ndesigned and developed to build a human-centric intelligent context-aware system that \ntakes into account their recent activities.\n\nThe most important work for intelligent context-aware system is to develop an effec-\ntive framework that supports for learning context-aware rules. Thus, in such a frame-\nwork, we need to consider advanced data analysis based on contexts using machine \nlearning techniques, so that the rule learning framework is capble to resolve these issues. \nThus, a well designed context-aware rule learning framework for contextual smart-\nphone data and the experimental evaluation is a very important direction and a big \nchallenge as well. In a summary, this paper has uncovered several future directions in \nthe field of smartphone data analytics and context-aware rule learning. First, additional \nstudy must be performed on the characteristics of smartphone data in terms of asso-\nciated and relevant contexts, as the context-aware rules depend on surrounding differ-\nent contexts. Second, the scalability and efficacy of existing analytics techniques being \napplied to smartphone data must be empirically examined. Third, new techniques and \nalgorithms or potential hybrid methods are needed to be designed while learning con-\ntext-aware rules, particularly, in terms of time-series modeling, effective rule discovery \nbased on multi-dimensional contexts, and recency-based incremental learning for intel-\nligent decision making utilizing enormous amounts of smartphone data. Fourth, a range \nof empirical evaluation is necessary to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of these \nmachine learning techniques while comparing with existing techniques. Fifth, more \nwork is necessary on how to efficiently model context-aware rules in relevant application \nareas for the purpose of building intelligent context-aware applications.\n\n\n\nPage 17 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\nSuggested machine learning based framework\nAccording to the survey of contextual smartphone data and corresponding rule learn-\ning strategies, in this section, we suggest a context-aware rule learning framework based \non machine learning techniques. Figure 2 shows an overview of the suggested context-\naware rule learning framework highlighting various components starting from the bot-\ntom raw contextual data to real world applications and services. The framework typically \nconsists of four processing layers such as contextual data acquisition layer, context dis-\ncretization layer, rule discovery layer, and finally dynamic updating and management \nlayer, shown in Fig. 2. In the following, we briefly discuss about these layers and their \nroles in learning context-aware rules from smartphone data. These are:\n\nContextual data acquisition This represents the first layer of our context-aware rule \nlearning framework as collecting relevant data is the first step to build a data-driven sys-\ntem. Thus, this layer is responsible to collect individual’s smartphone data that includes \ntheir daily life activities with their phones and corresponding associated contextual \ninformation such as temporal context, spatial context, social context or others relevant \nto the particular usage. Such contextual data can be collected from various sources like \nsmartphone logs, sensors or external sources relevant to the application. Smartphone \ndata collected from these sources usually contains raw contexts that characterize indi-\nviduals’ daily life behavioral activities with their phones, and need to process effectively \nto use as the basis for learning context-aware rules.\n\nFig. 2 An overview of the suggested machine learning based context-aware rule learning framework\n\n\n\nPage 18 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\nContext discretization Machine learning based context discretization represents the \nsecond layer in our context-aware rule learning framework. Once we have available con-\ntextual raw data collected from the data acquisition layer, discretization of contexts is \nneeded to understand the actual meaning of data, which is also known as contextual data \nclustering, highlighted in Fig. 2. In other words, contextual data with similar character-\nistics are grouped in one cluster and dissimilar characteristics are grouped in another \ncluster. For instance, real-world smartphone data contains continuous raw contextual \ninformation like time-series data that represents individual’s diverse activities in differ-\nent data points in time order. Such particular data points separately may not represent \na meaningful behavior of users. A data-driven time-series segmentation using machine \nlearning techniques could give an effective discretization results according to the data \npatterns available in the source. Thus, the main purpose of this layer is to create contex-\ntual data clusters, e.g., segments or contextual groups according to similar data charac-\nteristics. The processed data in this layer helps to find the hidden patterns that are used \nas the basis of learning context-aware rules.\n\nRule discovery Machine learning based contextual rule discovery represents the third \nlayer in our context-aware rule learning framework, shown in Fig. 2. As different con-\ntexts might have different impacts on individuals’ usage behavior in the real world, the \nprecedence analysis of contexts can play a role to discover a set of effective rules, high-\nlighted in Fig. 2. Based on the precedence of contexts, this layer is responsible to gen-\nerate a set of users’ behavioral rules by taking into account relevant multi-dimensional \ncontexts such as temporal context, spatial context, social context or others relevant. The \ngenerated behavioral rules are effective and efficient in terms of reliability that repre-\nsents higher decision making accuracy, conciseness by taking into account the generali-\nzation and non-redundancy, context importance by taking into account the precedence \nof contexts, and lower training time by considering the computing resources in individu-\nals’ devices. Thus, this layer is responsible to generate a set of contextual rules based on \nrelevant multi-dimensional contexts by taking into account these aspects. After discov-\nering rules, this layer is also responsible to rank these rules according to their relevancy \nin terms of contexts and rule’s strength.\n\nDynamic updating and management layer Machine learning based dynamic updat-\ning and management of the discovered rules represents the final layer in our con-\ntext-aware rule learning framework, shown in Fig. 2. As individuals’ usage behavior \nare not static in the real world, may change over time, the recency analysis and min-\ning, and corresponding rule updation can play a role to dynamically update the dis-\ncovered rules over time, highlighted in Fig. 2. Based on the recent behavioral patters \nof individuals’ behavior, this layer outputs a set of users’ behavioral rules by taking \ninto account the relevant contexts. The main benefit of this layer is that it takes into \naccount the most recent pattern that represents the freshness in individuals’ behav-\nior in a particular context, which is likely to be more significant than older ones for \npredicting their future usage. Thus, this layer is one of the significant layers that is \nresponsible to identify the behavioral changing patterns over time, and to update \nand manage the rules dynamically according to their changes in behavioral activities.\n\nOverall, our suggested machine learning based framework is responsible to extract \na set of effective behavioral rules of individual mobile phone users based on relevant \n\n\n\nPage 19 of 25Sarker  J Big Data            (2019) 6:95 \n\nmulti-dimensional contexts utilizing their smartphone data. The extracted context-\naware rules can be used to build various rule-based intelligent systems, in order to \nnot only provide them the target personalized services that may vary from user to \nuser but also the population services in the relevant application areas.\n\nContext‑aware rule based applications\nA context-aware rule based smartphone application represents knowledge in terms of \na set of IF-THEN rules, (i.e., if contexts then user behavioral activities or preferences) \nthat tells what to do or what to conclude in different situations [121] and can act as \na software agent. According to [98], software agent is a new paradigm for developing \nsoftware applications in which an agent is capable of performing autonomous actions \nin a certain environment to achieve it’s goal. The target applications of this research \nare those context-aware personalized applications that have been studied widely in \nthe past few years. For instance, intelligent mobile interruptions management sys-\ntem in one of them. The most popular IoT device, smartphones, are considered to be \n‘always on, always connected’ device and they are always with their users; however \nthe users are not always able to response with the incoming communications because \nof their various day-to-day situations [122]. For this reason, sometimes people are \noften interrupted by incoming phone calls in a working environment [123]. Accord-\ning to the Basex BusinessEdge report [124], the mobile interruptions consume 28% \nof the knowledge worker’s day. It leads to a loss of $700 billion according to Bureau \nof Labor Statistics [125]. In order to manage such interruptions, a number of authors \n[24, 65–67, 126] have studied on static rule based systems. However, the machine \nlearning based context-aware rules can be used to make such system automated and \nintelligent.\n\nSmartphone apps management could be another useful applications for individual \nusers. According to the statistics in Google search, in March 2017, there were 2.8 mil-\nlion apps available at Google Play Store, and 2.2 million apps in the Apple’s App Store. \nThus, its very important to manage such kind of huge amount of available applications. \nMachine learning based context-aware rules can be used to manage these apps accord-\ning to individual’s preferences. Besides apps management, several notifications from dif-\nferent apps are potentially annoying to the users and causes disruptions [7, 127, 128]. \nThe reason is that the users might get irritated for such uninterested phone notifications \n[129, 130]. Thus, machine learning based context-aware rules can also be applicable to \nmanage such notifications intelligently.\n\nSmartphone recommendation system is one of the most",
